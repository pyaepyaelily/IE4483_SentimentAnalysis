About... 2 days later, my IPod fell out of my jacket pocket and tumbled hard down a flight of CONCRETE stairs.  I was sure that it was damaged... but, I opened the case, turned it on, and and was fine.... I was quite relieved.  That alone justifies the price of the case. I am proud to say that it is still in there to this day, and the only thing I could have asked for would have been a somewhat tighter fit around the clickwheel, as there is a bit of space for dirt\/dust to get into.  That and the whole made for the headphones could be a tad bigger."

I bought this chromium gray pair from M A C Y * S directly, but they weren't any cheaper. I have 2 other pairs of the same pants in khaki and black (also not from A m a z o n).\n\nThese pants are true cargo with the side leg pockets, the flaps on the rear pockets (carpenter pants don't have the closeable flap on back, but still have at least one side pocket). The material is soft cotton. I feel like I'm wearing a pair of pajamas when I wear these and I love that. The pants wrinkle easily, but that's the price you pay for sheer comfort.

I've been using my Lily Padz since my daughter (now nearly 4 weeks old) was a few days old.  (We had latch-on problems initially, so I used washable pads until my nipples healed.)  I really like this product.  It's smooth under clothing, and it clings pretty reliably.  It isn't perfect, but it doesn't claim to be.  When I have a gushing let-down, nothing will contain it, not Lily Padz nor cloth breast pads.  That's a little disappointing, but I suppose it's to be expected.  I only wish that the tackiness held up a little better.  I have tended lovingly to my Lily Padz, following instructions on washing and drying and what not.  In fact, I only wear them during the day.  At night, I wash them before I go to bed, and leave them on the domes to dry over night (using the washables at night).  Despite following the instructions on Lily Padz maintenance very carefully, I feel they've lost their tackiness, and I worry about their effectiveness.  So far, no big problems, but I'd feel more secure if they did not appear to have started to wear out already.  Still - they're totally worth the investment, and I may just buy another pair, so I can alternate and keep wear to a minimum"

        "reviews":"I've been using the GT-2000 series shoes for about 2+ years now, and I can honestly say, they're the most comfortable running shoes for my build.  This is one of Asics best, if not the best, selling shoes because it offers such a wide variety of fit for most foot types.\n\nThese shoes are mainly designed for the moderate to heavy over-pronator (when the feet roll in too much) with low to medium arches, but I've met fellow runners with the same shoe who have medium to high arches.  I, myself, am flat-footed, but use orthotics.  This can be a major problem for me when buying shoes because I need something with a wide enough heel to allow my orthotics to fit, and these work great.  Don't worry if you don't have a wide heel because there is memory foam embedded in the heel that forms to your foot over time.  \n\nThe heel and forefoot also offer a good amount of stability and support.  The shoe is designed for medium to large builds, but again, I've come across other runners who are much lighter and use the same shoe.  When I first began running, I weighed 300+ pounds, now at 216 pounds, the shoes still work well (I've bought newer version of this shoe as I've worn the others out).  \n\nThe \"Upper\" (the top parts of the shoe) are really comfortable.  It's made of a mesh material that allows a maximum amount of air and circulation into the foot, while allowing all the heat, moisture & sweat out.  The shoe is so comfortable, you could easily run in it without socks (which I have done only a few times).  \n\nThe 2000 series are versatile, they're well priced, and they come in a variety of sizes, widths, and colors, so chances are they'll fit you.  This is by far the best running shoe I've used up to date, and would recommend it to anyone who is just starting or a long time runner."

Unfortunately, I am an innately messy person - a slob, really - and laundry service is not good, to say the least. It's a step up from pounding clothes on a rock. The little swine have trashed several pairs of trousers that I did nothing more than drink coffee, eat a tough steak, and smoke a cigar in - my good wool trousers looked like earthtone Picasso sketches. But not these Lees. I can get mud, coffee, blood, whatever on them, and then give them to a fellow who I know will wash and dry them on the highest heat imaginable. Nevertheless, they come out fine.\n\nI will buy another couple pairs - but not soon, as I don't think these are going to wear out for a good long time. My unstinting support, wholehearted recommendation, and so forth. Buy these trousers. Sure they may cost a smidge more than, I duno Dockers. But nobody ever looked at khakis that they had spilled red wine, grease, and blood on, and, finding no evidence of a stain, said, \"Damn - I spent too much for these."

I'm 5'4, and they hit at just the right point on my calves, although if I was much shorter, I might think that they were too long. I have an athletic build, but large hips, and I was worried these might make me look huge, but they are very flattering on my body type (I also have a friend who has a pair that is quite slim - a size 2- and they work beautifully on her too). They are ultra comfy and have just the right amount of stretch. Because they are mostly polyester, they aren't really breathable, but they are so lightweight, it's not a factor for me. They are also virtually wrinkle-proof. If you're looking to buy gauchos, or just a comfy pair of hip pants to hit the town in, I would definately recommend these"

They are extremely durable, and VERY comfortable.  They have so much padding and cushion, I like just wearing them around the house, and they feel like you have slippers on.  \n\nThe Thorlo XJ-11 Running Crew Socks were also very nice, well padded, etc., but were A LOT more expensive, and I actually prefer these Russell socks better.  The Thorlo's don't breath nearly as well.\n\nI highly recommend these socks.  A good value, very durable, extremely comfortable, great cushion for runners, and breath great.\n\nKevi"

It is very tough to find a retailer with Falcons in the size and width you need. This is very unfortunate as the Falcon is comfortable, durable, and \"smart\" looking. I became a fan of these shoes the moment I stepped into them - they require no breaking in period.  You put 'em on and you feel like you've been wearing them for years.  They are suitable for every day wear in less-than-business-suit-required work environments. The Falcon comes in brown and black suede with a leather upper portion around the side and back of the shoe. Many newer Clark's seem to be crafted with ugly thick soles, and an upturned front. A water-proofing spray can be applied to the Falcon without marring or significantly darkening its appearance.  If you can find a pair of these shoes, I recommend applying the water proofing - it'll add months of wear."

Further, it's pretty much impossible to find a soft cup\/non-underwire that does all of the above.\n\nThis bra is supportive, comfortable, pretty (the lace in the cleavage really does look like a cami under tops) and your breasts don't look like 'uni-boob.' One tip for new nursing moms: definitely don't use underwire bra's. I made that mistake at first (for the support) and got recurring mastitis--not fun AT ALL"

I read once in a medical publication that physicians warn against g-strings and thongs that wedge themselves in you-know-where because the fabric acts as a wick for bacteria to migrate forward.  (Try not to vomit.)  Well, I'm one of those people who can't get a picture like that out of her mind once it, er, wedges itself in there, so I was about as anti-thong as a person could be.  But sometimes you can't (or don't dare) go commando.  In that case, a thong is mandatory.  What to do??  A salesperson sold me on the Hanky Panky thong, and I'm thrilled to say that she didn't misguide me.  The fit is loose (I know, a loose thong?--but that's the best way I can describe it) so the fabric skims the outside of your body and doesn't wedge itself in.  They're the ONLY comfortable thong I've ever worn.  So: comfy fit, no bacteria wicking -- you can't do better than that."

There is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location.  You break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off. Believe me, I tried.  I really wanted to keep the boots based on the look.  Once on, they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all.  I am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe.  I tend to be pretty easy.  I just could not make these work!  Sorry"

Do not worry about it messing with the magnetic strips on your credit\/bank cards. I know this was a concern for me before I bought it, but it turned out to be a false impression. As far as the gentleman who had problems with it demagnetizing his room key, that's typical. In fact, since those are meant to be reprogrammed often, they are not nearly as strong as credit and bank cards. I've had loose change in my pocket demagnetize room keys before. \n\nKeep in mind the positives: Not only is it very compact, but can hold six credit cards\/bank cards, a driver's license, and more. The leather wears very well. Moreover, it is small enough to fomfortably fit into the front pocket of my jeans.\n\nNegatives: Cannot hold fat wads of money, which isn't a problem for me but could be for others"

Remember, there is no drawstring or elastic in the waist, so be cautious about jumping a full size upward.  36\" is a Large, but 34\" you might go Medium instead.\n\n* Wears fine as active underwear, with no visible seams under running tights, and no discomfort during \"dry\" workouts in the gym or the great outdoors"

        "reviews":"I am a deployed Navy Reservist.  I am currently assigned to a tactical expeditionary unit deployed to the middle-east where I serve in a TACCOMM\/Tactical Crypto Support role in land and maritime operations.  Before deploying, I spent a great deal of time and effort in selecting the 'right boot' in which I knew I would be spending a great deal of time.  I tried Oakley, Converse, 5.11 and of course the Bates M-9.  I felt that there was no contest.  The Bates was by far the most comfortable and seemed to have the most functional sole design and least potentially irritating upper, and so on. \n\nLet me re-wind a little bit.  In my civilian life, outside of the Reserve (which at this point seems a distant memory) I am an avid runner, to the tune of about 70 miles per week.  While I've run many hundred of miles on roads, my focus over the past couple of years has shifted to off-road 'trail runs' and ultra-marathon courses.  I know my feet.  I know what works in a shoe that is going to be demanded to perform in horrible conditions.  I have had great success over time with literally one pair of shoes from one manufacturer and as such I bought many pairs of that shoe.  In June of 2006, I bought my first pair of M-9 Desert Assault boots to take on my July deployment.  I decided that in order to break them in, I'd take them on the trail.  I figured that they'd tear my feet up a bit, but it wouldn't be the first time a new shoe had done so.  The day I first wore them I set off with an 85lb. pack into a tick infested trail in a local state park.  It was about 100 degrees outside with humidity nearly to match.  After 12 miles on the trail I returned home to find that my feet were all but un-fouled!  I was amazed.  I would repeat this process a few times and very soon after ordered two additional pairs of M-9s. \n\nFast forward just a bit. While in pre-deployment training in Coronado, CA, I took to wearing my boots for all of our PT.  I also logged about 30 to 50 miles per week of independent running, again, in my M-9s.  Most of these runs included a pack with about 50 - 70lbs in it, though now I was running almost entirely on pavement.  My M-9's performed without flaw.  I left Coronado for the middle east without any doubt that I had the best boots I could have possibly chosen, and they were well broken in to boot. ;)\n\nFast forward some more.  Recently I was able to take a two day MWR trip in order to run the Dubai (UAE) Marathon...in my M-9s.  While we (there were five of us from my unit that ran the marathon) have had almost no opportunity to do any training runs while in theater, I knew that if I were to tackle 26.2 miles on pavement (man, I hate running on pavement), there was no way I was going to do so without wearing my 'old faithfuls'.  They did not disappoint!  While I took a very conservative pace, my M-9s carried me with ease to the finish line.  My Chief, also the proud owner of a well beaten pair of M-9's ran the marathon with me, his first ever.  He too wore his M-9s, as his running shoes were simply shot.  He was nothing short of elated to have finished his first marathon attempt, and others were nothing short of amazed that he did it in 'combat boots'.  If they only knew. ;)  I must say, I've never had so many people come up to me during a marathon to chat and in every case, the topic was my choice of footwear.  In every instance I would simply tell them with a smile, \"You don't understand, these are really great boots.\" \n\nIn short, Bates created a nearly perfect boot. Are there things I would change? Certainly. But even if Bates never changes a thing about them, I will keep buying them until I am not longer able to run, which I assure you will not be for a very long time.  I have already scheduled additional marathons and ultra-marathons (off road of course) for after I return home, and I'll let you guess what my choice of footwear will be.  I have found my new 'running shoe'."

It has several pockets and since I hardly ever carry cash I can use the extra space for receipts and the soft cards. Much slimmer and lighter to carry. The change purse part is small but isn't a problem for me since I don't carry that much change anyway.  Since change is bulky by nature, I would prefer a separate change purse anyway.

Hmmmm...  no wonder no one has  reviewed these  yet -- who writes a review for men's underwear?  \n\nOk, fine, I'll do it.  I love these, my preferred brand and style. Your brand and your style may vary as this category of apparel tends to be a personal preference item.\n\nI only buy these in black as I am a firm believer that underwear (men's especially) should not be white -- as by the time the end of the day rolls around and it's time to change them  -- it's better to be left  wondering  what might be there as opposed to seeing it so prominently displayed on a white background!\n\nThese hold up well for the price.  Nothing lasts forever. The elastic band is usually the first to go (after many repeated washings) before the material gives out.  i.e. they will fall off before they rot off. \n\nFinally, so I can feel like I have done a complete job in reviewing these, I had a buddy of mine help with the ultimate test - the Weggie test - and these shorts handled it well...  extreme pain was reached well before the structure and\/or material of the boxer short failed.  I give these a \"ten tippy toes\" rating for how well they performed in the test."

Much more comfortable than my $150 pair of running shoes!  They've got a stylish design and are priced pretty well.\n\nMy purpose for buying these are for river tubing & general walking around on an upcoming cruise and I'm confident now that these will serve that purpose nicely.\n\nThe only downside to this shoe is that the sole doesn't look as nice as the women's version.  My wife got the same shoe but for women and her soles were clear while mine was black.  Nothing major, but hers looks much better than mine when looking at them both from the bottom (not that I'll ever see them from that angle while I'm wearing them)."

Unfortunately, I need to wear sandals for medical reasons and apparently no one (including Columbia) makes a water aerobics sandal.

They handle the water just fine, drying completely in about 8 hours and show no sign of falling apart.  The traction isn't as strong as I would like, but it's better than bare feet or having damaged toes from shoes.  Also, the sandals create more drag in the water than regular water aerobics shoes, making my feet cramp more than they probably would have.

The 514 has a very large range of sizes and trendy washes, and is usually on sale for a very reasonable price at $30.\n\nI recommend this fit for thin men, tall or short, who I think look best on. Men who aren't comfortable with wearing tight jeans shouldn't purchase this fit, because it is certainly figure revealing. It's slimmer around the thigh, unlike the Skinny 511 jeans, where it's much tighter around both the calf and the thigh. The waist is a low rise, which I find very comfortable while wearing, and the leg opening is a straight cut. The 514 shrinks slightly when washed and dried.\n\nI personally think this fit is better looking than the Skinny 511, which I believe is just a fad for now. The Skinny has a sort of tapered-mom-jean look to it, and I don't think anyone will agree that a guy looks good in that!

I stopped using the sack when my babies outgrew it, and now I only used the outer wrap. I removed the top piece of velcro on the back of the wrap (designed to attach to the sack) because it seems like it could be irritating. I know that there's some SIDS rationale for using the sack plus the wrap, but I do the wrap really tight so I'm confident that there's no way it could come off and get over my babies' heads.\n\nSome tips: I tighten the velcro iteratively -- I wrap the baby snuggly once, then I open up each half and re-tighten it. Also, I wrap the bottom half of my babies in a snug traditional swaddle with a blanket. They like having their legs tightly wrapped, and this system allows me to focus on their arms with the Halo wrap and on their legs with a blanket"

I'd used up my GTX Sundowners (4th pair of Vasque boots) that I've had for about 3 years.  This is the first pair that squeaks.  I like good shoes, and I like taking care of them.  I had always been proud to wear Vasque, but the quality of these is just not that great.  The leather is thinner, and is dimpling, so they even look cheaper.  It's a shame, I wish Red Wing (another brand I`ve enjoyed in the past) had not acquired Vasque. It is the end of a great tradition"

The cup fabric is itchy at first, but a handwash in woolite will fix that. \n\nThe only problem I have, is that this bra doesn't push the breasts up to the cup!

I can easily fit say three pairs of slacks and two shirts into it.  If you want to carry more or fewer pieces, it's forgiving.  I use it for suit jackets too, folding them in across the width of the folder.\n\nI've used mine often over perhaps 8 years, and they still look like new.\n\nA standard-sized 21\" roll-aboard suitcase will neatly hold: 1 18-inch folder (this product), two full-sized Pack-It cubes, a small pack-it sac holding travel adapters and rechargers, a toiletries bag (not from this sytem) and a pair of shoes (squeezed).

The one disadvantage this bra has is that when putting it on, the straps sometimes come out of the slot where they are hooked.  You sometimes have to readjust them 2-3 times when putting it on.

Each filtration system, which screws into the inside of the water bottle, lasts about 26 gallons (about 100 liters) after which you have to replace it, costing about US$22. \n\nI have been using the bottle in rural peru and have had no problems.

The wallet has 15 credit card slots (and you can carry more if you double up), and a window for your driver's license conveniently located on the checkbook flap. The zippered compartment is wide, and has two big open pockets for your bills, and papers; a credit card holder(that's part of the 15 counted) and a center zippered compartment. I am on my second Big Fat Wallet. It is the only wallet that fits all my stuff. I can go to the ATM and immediately put my cash in this wallet and zipper it up. I don't have to fumble trying to stuff it into slim pockets like other wallets I have owned. The new edition (which is the one pictured here) has an extra fastener so it can accomodate your wallet's growth, and stay closed. It also has a pocket under the front flap.  The only complaint is that the ID window that you could pull out out from the back pocket and then have it \"pop\" back doesn't do that anymore. Instead of a elastic band that attached the window to the wallet, Mundi substituted a plastic fastner..like the kind that stores use to hang price tags on clothes. All in all, for a leather wallet at this low price, you can't go wrong. Yes, the leather isn't glove soft or for that matter a high quality leather, but I'd rather not have a flashy expensive wallet.

He wasn't a happy camper, but I did send it back, and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me.  I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange.

Finally, I saw a podiatrist who referred me to a pedorthist to be fitted with footwear that could alleviate my pain.  I wound up with a pair of Birkenstock sandals and I've never turned back.\n\nThey're great.  No more foot pain, period.  I wear dress socks and the sandals to work everyday (in an office environment -- I got flack for that from co-workers, but the needling didn't bother me and management never took me to task, either), to church, everywhere.  I've a different pair of Birkies for the beach and lawn work -- not as comfortable as the suede uppers on these Arizona's.  The mocha suede straps have held up wonderfully despite getting wet and lightly soiled from time to time.\n\nAdmittedly, it's a lot of money to spend, but the shoe store my pedorthist works in re-soles the Birkies for about $30, and will replace the cork and sole both for about $50.  The re-soled sandals last about a year, but remember, I wear them daily and I often walk a few miles each day.\n\nIn short, these sandals have dramatically improved the quality of my life and foot arthritis is no longer any concern for me.  Not bad for a little more than $100"

Sounds like baloney but it's not.\n\nI cannot overstate how pleased I have been with mine.  Great traction and they show essentially no wear thus far.  It scares me to think what it will take to wear these things out.  I didn't buy them for looks, but I've had several compliments on them.\n\nSome additional observations -- There is essentially no break in period.  You can hit it hard with them right out of the box and they'll treat your feet well.  Although a slip-on, due to their substantial construction, they do not pull on all that easily.  You have to use the handy heel tab provided and give a pretty good tug.\n\nAs they look kind of like a running shoe (the \"chameleon effect\" again) I gave them a go on a two mile jog.  BIG MISTAKE.  I might as well have been wearing steel-toe engineer boots.  These things have a substantial heel element concealed in the shoe and they felt like they weighed a ton.  They are not cross-trainers and are not suited as running shoe.  \n\nI fully recommend these for situations where one is on their feet all day and a casual\/sports appearing shoe is appropriate.

As advertized, the waistband construction lies flat and does not roll, and the contour pouch gives good, but realistic, definition that can be appreciated by others.  Well worth the price"

This company had amazingly fast shipping, I am absolutely awe struck. It was here within a week even though the predicted time was that it would be \"SHIPPED\" in like 2 weeks. The product is super cute, good material. The only thing is I had to kind of guess on the size, they didn't really give a swim suit sizing method, but if you think about it, whenever you buy online it is a guessing game. Great shipping, affordable price, and not a cheaply made product. It's an adorbable swim suit, and I'll most likely check here first for next years swim suit"

        "reviews":"While much of the negative commentary concerned Levi Strauss's move away from domestic manufacturing has focused on the button-fly 501s, the bigger problem I have seen is with the old 1970's standby, the 505, which has a zipper as opposed to button fly. The variability on sizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order. You really have to try them on to see how they fit. The 501 are much easier to buy online or by mail order because the sizing is much less critical on the waist, which is the so-called \"anti-fit\" waist, meaning there is no curve to the rise (the distance between the crotch and the top of the waist), because the original 501s were merely cut down bib overalls which were made to hang, rather than be fitted to the waist. The biggest problem I have noted on the 505's is the variability in size in the thigh area, meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight, even though they are theoretically the same size of a label. Since the 501s are more forgiving as far as sizing, if you are buying online you might consider them instead of 505s, unless you don't want the button fly."

        "reviews":"I am a huge fan of Under Armour's workout apparel, and in addition to owning several of these Tech T-shirts, also own several each of the Loose Gear shirts (0084) and the Heat Gear compression shirts (0039) - I've written reviews on those as well.\n\nThe Tech T-shirt (0382) feels really good on your skin - like your favorite, most comfortable old cotton t-shirt. It looks just like cotton and has a matte finish - it's not shiny\/silky like the Loose Gear shirts or Heat Gear compression shirts. It is very soft, comfortable and lightweight, and I love this shirt both for working out and casual wear. The shirt runs true to size (buy your regular T-shirt size and it will fit really well), and is the roomiest cut of the Under Armour shirts. I absolutely LOVE the raglan sleeves on the tech tee - one of the features that makes them so comfortable and gives them a little bit of a unique look.\n\nThe tech tee has a small amount of a lycra-like fabric in with the polyester microfiber, which gives it quite a bit of stretch. I like this because the shirt doesn't bind if you're doing something that really requires you to reach or stretch - certain weight exercises, aerobics, yoga, etc. The shirt works the way it's supposed to, and wicks moisture from your skin for rapid evaporation.\n\nThe tech tee is available in numerous colors (I have 6 of them) and in spite of the fact that the fabric is thin and lightweight, the shirts are very opaque. The shirts have a nice cut and look great over jeans or shorts - in addition to the gym, I often wear them out and around, or when working in the yard. They are super comfortable worn as an undershirt too, but are probably a little costly for that. Like all the Under Armour shirts, they have a self-material neck band, but it fits just right and says in place, even if you get sweaty - it doesn't sag like the cotton ones.\n\nWhile I have zero complaints about the tech tee, be aware that it is Under Armour's \"budget\" product, if there is such a thing. The material does start to pill after a few washings - this affects appearance slightly, but not performance or fit. Although I haven't worn out ANY of my Under Armour shirts yet, I'm going to venture that the tech t-shirt won't be quite as durable as their signature Loose Gear shirts and Heat Gear compression shirts, nor does it perform quite as well. On the other hand it, it's about 20% cheaper, so as with anything else, you get what you pay for.\n\nWhen stacked up against UA's other shirts, I'd say the tech tee is for you if:\n\n1) You like the look and feel of a soft, cotton t-shirt but want the wicking and performance of a microfiber shirt.\n\n2) You don't care for the shiny, silky, more synthetic look and feel of the Loose Gear shirts, or the tightness of the Heatgear compression shirt.\n\n3) You want a shirt that's a little roomier.\n\n4) You want a shirt with stretch in it.\n\n5) You want to save a little $$ but still wear an authentic UA logo shirt"

This is all you need to keep you in place. They don't cover any more than they need to. They're all you need when you jog (I don't think anyone actually wears them swimming anymore). The swimmer jock style in general is like that, regardless of the manufacturer. However, I'm giving it a 4 because I prefer jocks in non-cotton fabrics like nylon, polyester, and Coolmax. They are much softer and can whick better. Plus, there are now ones that look more modern and have funkier colors, such as ones by Calvin Klein and Baskit. Why not add to your fun when you jog?"

The House of Rice silk parasol, however, is an exception to the rule. They manage to be pretty, useful and surprisingly sturdy.\n\nExcept for a white, painted handle, the parasol's frame is entirely made of bamboo. It looks fragile, but is surprisingly sturdy, especially since it is bound together with colorful threads and bamboo pegs. Over that is asemi-transparent pale yellow silk canopy, and a matching ribbon on the top to hang it from.\n\nHow does it stand up in the sun? Well, the silk is technically transparent, but when unfolded it does provide a certain amount of shade -- about the same as a pair of sunglasses. Aesthetically, it is also very good, simple and unadorned except by a few extra scraps of silk, but very elegant and understated. The only problem is that to keep the parasol open, you have to essentially shove it up onto a jutting wedge of bamboo. It's a bit of a pain to close.\n\nThe House of Rice silk parasol is meant to look pretty, but it can also be used for the parasol's origina function. Definitely a good find, if you can get it closed easily"

Then again - if you aren't enjoying life, are you really living? \"LiveWrong\" doesn't take anything away from the good work that many are doing - nor does it fall into the category of all the pseudo-charities who are jumping on the band wagon.

Secondly, I was attracted to the general style of these shoes, which when worn with long pants gives the appearance of a pump without flying of my foot like pumps do. The crowning feature of this pair was its five inch heel. Therefore, for style and color, I would give this shoe five stars. \n\nUnfortunately, I was disappointed by the way the shoe balanced. It required a lot more concentration to walk in than most five inch heels. This is due to its very thin stiletto heel. Also, it is rather painful. Albeit, most five inch heels are very painful. Therefore, I would not recommend wearing these shoes for extended periods of time, nor on slick surfaces. Luckily, the clasp on the top of the shoes did not dig into my leg, as I expected it would. Overall, I would give these shoes a three star rating as far as comfort is concerned. \n\nI have ordered items from this seller numerous times and have been very pleased with them. They ship quickly and their items are always good quality. I highly recommend them.\n\n- Ravenov"

Nice tag inside stating made in Turkey.  \n\nPackaging:  Arrived in a plastic zipped bagged, nicely folded.\n\nSize:  We are both a normal weight range 5' 6\".  These are a one-size fits all robe, so,  as always, they are bit large, but we both like them that way.   The sleeves reach to my knuckles, but the stitching is such that the robes look finished even with the cuffs folded back.   \n\nContent:  These are looped 100% cotton, just what we wanted.  We were searching for 100% cotton bathrobes that we could use in winter to get to\/from our hot tub.

It protected him from the sun. It dried quickly and looked good in and out of the water. It isn't as tight as the rash protection shirts so it wears more like a t-shirt but my husband preferred the more loose fit. The fabric is perfect for water. He even wore it on our cruise ship to dine at the buffet table after a swim since it looked so good. We liked it so much, we bought one for my father who also has fair skin. He said it was his favorite gift. If you need sun protection but still want to be active in water and sun, this is a great shirt to have.  You do have to hand wash it and hang to dry but I just soak it in cool water with Tide then rinse and hang. It's a snap. We're avid swimmers, SCUBA divers and snorkelers.

There is a review that said the dress comes in larger than expected so I ordered a size small.  The shipping is very fast.  I ordered on a Thursday evening and received the dress on Monday (I do live in the same state where the company is in).  However, the dress is too tight.  I'm 5 ft 4 inches, weigh 120 lbs., and I usually wear a women's size 2 (i.e., Banana Republic, Express).  I will be exchanging the item for a medium.  For the price, the dress is a good bargain.  It is sheer on the bottom, so you will need a slip underneath.  The beading is nice (extra beads are included) and the way the dress flares out at the bottom is very unique.  The dress was long on me, and would probably need to be taken in at least 3 inches.  The clasp are loosely sewn on (two broke after I took off the dress), so I would have a seamstress sew it on more tightly.  The dress also arrives folded, so you will need to take care of the wrinkles.  Overall, I'm happy with the dress for its price and design and I can't wait to receive the correct size"

I was tired of having mismatched tags that I had scraped up from anywhere and everywhere. I was also looking for a tag that kept my personal information covered up from strangers standing nearby. Another thing I was looking for was a tag that was strong. It was not uncommon for me to pick up my luggage in the airport to discover my tag had been ripped off. Sometimes part of it was left. Sometimes all of it was gone. Luggage and their tags take a lot of abuse.\n\nOK about this product...They are real leather. They are nice looking. There are two reasons why I am giving this product a 4 instead of a 5 rating. First the leather is a little on the thin side. It would be a nice thickness to make a ladies purse or a fine wallet for a businessman in a suit but...a luggage tag? Like I said, these tags need to be virtually indestructable to survive. I am a little dubious that the thin leather strap will really hold up. I may be wrong...this is only my speculation at this point. The second thing is the price. It seems to me that this product should be in the 3 to 4 dollar, each, price range instead of the 5 to 6 dollar range.\n\nThere are different colors available which is good (I bought green) because nowadays 95% of all the bags coming down the conveyor are BLACK. Everyone needs something on the outside of their bag to help make it easily identifiable. These colored tags do that"

The leather is decent quality for the price, and they look absolutely fantastic on*.  They are very comfortable.  I can't be any more pleased with the way they look and the feel.\n\nThe drawbacks, however, were disappointing.  I have narrow calves anyway, but these boots' shafts are so wide, they flap around my calves like sails.  I can literally stuff my fist in between my calf and the boot without stretching the boot.  The straps and buckles aren't adjustable, so I'm not going to be able to wear them with skirts as I had planned because they'll look pretty silly, like I'm stomping around in my grandfather's waders or something.  They are also very wide in the heel, even with socks my heel slipped up and down.\n\nIf you have very wide calves, or don't plan on wearing them with anything other than long pants, I can't recommend them enough.  Like I said, they are decent quality, well-lined, and they look great on.  I just wish I'd had warning about the width before I ordered them"

        "reviews":"I recently purchased a small AmeriBag Healthy Back Bag in anticipation of a long summer trek through Europe.  I didn't think my backpack would be secure from pickpocketers, and I wanted something a little more \"grown up.\"  Here are some reasons I am very happy with this purchase:\n\n1) Comfort.  My Healthy Back Bag is more comfortable than either a backpack or a large purse.  Its wide strap sets securely on my shoulder without a hand on it, and it adjusts easily so I can carry it across my chest.  You can put a lot in it and not feel the weight - you will not end up with your shoulder in knots at the end of the day.\n\n2) Security.  The zippered compartment openings fit neatly beneath my armpit; there are interior zipper pockets as well, so it's pretty hard to imagine someone's hand slipping into the bag without my knowing it.  The wide strap is reinforced so it would be hard to cut.\n\n3) Convenience.  This bag has supremely well-designed features.  On the outside, there is a flat zipper pocket (good for your subway pass) and a separate velcro pocket on one side, a velcro pocket with a flap on the other, and a small pocket suitable for (say) sunglass on the end. The main zipped compartment has a wide variety of open pockets (for perhaps a pen, a camera, a PDA or Ipod), including one conveniently placed sidways so you can easily get at it from when it's still on your shoulder.  That one is perfect for a cellphone.  There is a flat inside zipper pocket that serves me well as a wallet.\n\n4) Capacity.  I've got the small version of the bag, and it will still hold a wide variety of daily essentials: wallet, phone, camera, ipod, a paperback, a compact umbrella, and even perhaps a very light sweater.\n\nThe biggest problem with these bags is figuring out which one you want - err on the small side (they are more comfortable), then choose whatever fabric and color suits your fancy.  You can even get them in a premium leather, but my microfibre one seems easy to clean and a good value.\n\nThis is my favorite bag - I can easily see several decades in my future with a Healthy Back Bag under my arm."

        "reviews":"I purchased one of these shirts to see what the quality was compared to the price. As soon as I received it and wore it twice I went back and purchased three more. The weave on these shirts is thick making the shirt very comfortable to use and I suspect will give it a long life. After multiple (10+) washings, the first one I purchased still feels as good as the newer ones. The colors are warm. I would suspect that this shirt would cost $10-15. As long as the price stays below $10, I will continue to purchase these as all-purpose daily-wear\/work-out tshirt.\n\nAs for the comment that these fit smaller than most, I didn't have that experience. In Nike, Reebok, Gap, and Rusell Athletic tshirts, I wear a large. I wear a large in Artiga as well, and the fit is comparable to those brands with no noticeable shrinkage after washing"

There was no shoddy workmanship on these shoes. The soles were solidly attached to the body of the shoes. The velcro closure to the shoes is much appreciated as I did not want to waste time with lacing up shoes that could easily be untied. On a cosmetic level, the colors of the shoes were nice and neutral while still leaning towards boy's colors. \nI bought several of these in different sizes so that my boys will have comfortable shoes to wear as they grow. How nice it is to just reach up in the closet for the next size shoe! \nI would not hesitate to recommend these shoes to other parents."

The hoodie came with a place for my head and arms and the name hoodie is not a misnomer.  It had a fully functional and attached hood.  Studies show that we lose 70% of our body heat via our heads.  Well just put the hood up and you can keep all that heat.  Yes, with this hood you too can do your part to stem the tide of global warming.  If the hood is too big, well there are strings that are included that will allow you to close down the hood good and tight.  In fact you can go overboard and be your group of friends very own Kenny.

But, when you take into account the screen protector that's included (and which costs $15 by itself from other places), the stand on the back (which is, granted, mildly weak, but look at what it's holding up....if you watch your share of videos and movies on your Zen, as I do, the back-stand comes in very handy), and the other things, I would expect it to be more. So, don't let the cheap price deter you from getting this one, as it almost did me, thinking that it's poor quality. The sillicon tends to attract dust and lint, but it wipes or blows away easily, and is, really, the only thing that comes close to a downside. \n\nGet this case. You won't regret it"

Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either. \n\nI originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home. It's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step. They've replaced my slippers, mocassins, surf shoes and sandals."

The bumkins bibs can be washed thorougly with soap and water in the sink and then hung up.  They will be totally dry by the next meal!  They are so soft that our daugher doesn't mind wearing them.  They do not get in the way and stay nicely tucked (assuming our daughter doesn't pull the bib up to look for \"bib goodies\" in the pocket).  We bought 2 sets and could easily use more.

First off, the jacket worn with both the fleece inner lining and the outer shell is very warm for use outside on frigid winter days and the shell semeed to be waterproof or water resistant because even after rolling around in the snow it wasn't drenched. The outer shell by itself provides some warmth and also the water resistant outside to put over something else, say for example the suit jacket I wore to work. Definately not for winter use by itself but a nice compliment to something else. The fleece on its own is what I liked. Very warm and comfortable and stylish looks, I would constantly wear it around town by itself on a cool fall evening when out with friends.

The closed cell foam is very lightweight but dense so you can walk around in comfort. I wear them just about everyday to work. I chose the closed toe model without the holes in the top because I work in a laboratory where having your feet exposed is not a good idea. The ones with open holes in the top offer more ventilation. And, because Crocs float in water, they make great shoes for boating or kayaking. They drain well and dry out quickly, plus if you do manage to slip one off it will bob along on the surface until you fetch it. \n\nI know that a lot of doctors and nurses wear these because they allow you to stand comfortably for hours at a time. They are also great because they can very easily be washed off completely in just a couple of minutes. I wear them when I am gardening too and then just wash all the mud off the shoes with the hose outside.\n\nIn short, the Crocs are comfortable and versatile shoes. Treat your feet and buy them today"

These socks keep your feet warm with their wool fiber; and they are very well made and last forever. I especially like the way that they are reinforced at the heel and toe for lots and lots of wear. Oh sure, these socks may cost a bit more--but you get so much use out of them that these socks inevitably pay for themselves. \n\nThe socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12; therefore it is almost one size fits all. A big plus! I also like that the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers. Great!\n\nI would not dry these socks at high temperatures. This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot. Eventually they will \"bunch up\" when you wear them and that's very uncomfortable. Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature.\n\nOverall, you can't go wrong buying these socks. They keep your feet extra warm during colder weather. They are manufactured so well that you definitely get your money's worth. A good deal!\n\nSMILE"

Ken Cole has made a great pair of shoes.  I normally stay around $60 for each pair, so I went a bit further and it was definately worth it.  Hold these oxfords and you can instantly see the quality put into them.  These will last for a long time!  As far as comfort, the gel soles in them work fantastic.  The leather does take a little bit of wear before it forms to your foot, meaning the top edge around the ankle (especially the heal) rubs into you for about two or three days.  This sometimes happens with any new shoe.  Anyway, I would definately buy again"

Even though my strides are consistent in terms of length, pronation,and heal-to-toe gait, I tend to have very heavy footfalls (being a former sprinter with muscular legs)and need a well-cushioned shoe.\nI am training for the Boston Marathon and have tried Asics Gel Kayanos (the shoe designed for the \"clydesdale type\" runner), a pair of Adidas Adistars (the newest model is a very good shoe but didn't fit my wider foot properly), and some various pairs of New Balance (least favorites of the bunch) but the Mizuno Wave 7's are by far the most natural feeling, durable, light-weight, cushioned (without being bulky) shoe I have ever owned. I have now owned two of the Wave Creation 7's and a pair of the older Wave Creation 6's and put a lot of miles on these shoes: they consistently hold up mile after mile better than any of the other shoes out there. The Gel Kayanos are the only shoe remotely comparable but I found that they break down far to fast for distance running (and they are slightly heavy). That and the Mizuno's were comfortable from the first step and did not require any breaking which is very rare. I am confident I could switch to a new pair a week before a marathon and hardly notice a difference.  \n\nI would not only highly recommend this shoe to anyone with medium to heavy footfalls and a high arch but I endorse it as the only shoe I will buy as long as the line continues."

The smaller waistband allows for greater movement and a less restrictive fit especially if you're doing any kind of cardio exercise like running, biking or on the eliptical machine.  The contoured pouch is made of a blended fabric that allows for maximum moisture absorption and breatheability, while cupping and supporting you.  The leg straps are a comfortable width that don't roll or cut under your cheeks.  My only complaint is that I wish they would come out with a black version like they did with their standard Jock.\n\nGet rid of your old Jock and buy a bunch of these - I did!  Of course look around, the jocks here on Amazon seem to be a bit pricy, this $6.95 jock I found at a local sporting goods store for $3.99, or a 2-pack for $7.50"

In particular, the belt buckle seems of a higher quality than most, and that's been the point of failure of two of my previous packs.  (I wish I could find one with a metal buckle.)\n\nThere are two changes I would make to this design.  First, the side pockets are too small because they join the main part of the pack in a single seam.  The front panel of the side pocket needs to join the main front panel of the pack in a second seam maybe 3\/8\" farther forward.  This would make the side pockets much larger and more useful.\n\nBesides that, I note that there is only a single seam joining the belt to the pack.  Time will tell, but I suspect this may become a failure point.  A second or even third row of stitching here would make me feel more confident.\n\nAll that said, it seems like a very good pack -- the zippers and pulls are of high quality, the pockets are all lined, there are plenty of pockets including two security pockets for money and other small valuables -- and I would give it 4 1\/2 stars if I could -- just not 5 :-"

These are by far the most expensive shoes of any kind I have ever bought, and they were totally worth every penny.  In fact I bought a second pair of this same model because the first one was so good.  Normally I'd get five pairs of running shoes for the price of these two. (I'd love to get these at a deep discount, but just haven't found them anywhere.)\n\nThey take a lot of wear and tear.  I have run and walked well over 1,000 miles in these shoes and they are still practically like new, just a little worn in the center of the front sole.  Which is doubly amazing considering that I weigh over 250 pounds.  Usually I blow out a pair of shoes after just 300 or 400 miles.  \n\nAside from being slightly warm they are amazingly comfortable.  I can wear them all day at work, or for a fifteen-mile walk, and not have any discomfort.  The fit has been perfect, and usually that's a problem area for me.  These are snug without binding, and have all the right support in the right places.  No appreciable wear has occurred on the interior lining of the shoe.\n\nBrooks has been a very good brand for me, and these are far and away the best of their line that I have tried.  Compared the best stuff from New Balance, Asics, Saucony, Mizuno and other good brands that I have used, The Beast is on a completely different level"

        "reviews":"I was fortunate to be able to pick up the Chocolate Lab striped Oxford when it was offered in the winter.  There's nothing plain about this Oxford.  I would say classic because of the clean lines and gentle shaping provided by the darts in the back.  An additional benefit generally about all of Bealls' long-sleeve Oxfords is that they are shorter in length than most traditional Oxfords.  Most Oxford shirts are about 27\"-28\" in length in a Misses size (0-20), but Bealls' tend to run about 25\"-26\" depending on your size for proportion.  The advantage is that you do not feel the need to tuck, but you can still tuck if you would like.  Personally, I have never been a fan of tucking shirts into pants or skirts, especially if you want to highlight either.\n\nWhoever sews these garments takes great care.  The back darts are aligned perfectly and the button thread is done criss-cross style with a double looping underneath for extra strength.  The actual striping of the shirt is straight.  I've seen with some more expensive shirts where someone either didn't follow the pattern correctly or tried to correct an improper pattern badly.  To me, that makes a tremendous difference whether I will come back for more.\n\nI am looking forward to more colors again.  The Chocolate Lab stripe is the only one I own and I've had many ask me where I purchased.  I would love to see all of the colors which are offered in the 3\/4 sleeve version with the addition of a Kelly green, Gatsby Yellow (short-sleeve version color) and perhaps even a beautiful Violet.\n\nDefinitely try this shirt because I know you will be pleased"

The mermaidy tail is gorgeous and the length is perfect (5'10ish with heels). The size also matches well with the chart. All in all, this dress was more perfect than I'd hoped for and I'm very happy with it. It looks\/feels very glamourous! The only thing on the downside is that this type of dress isn't lined, so you can sorta picture the outline of belly button and even no-VPL panties"

These shoes have plenty of cushion in the heel and yet also support my arches.  However, I did put an extra arch support insert in (did I mention I have really high arches?) but didn't get the usual \"crowding\" effect which was wonderful. I've bought lots of shoes that were supposed to be right for my type of foot but after running in them had to eventually give them away.  These shoes were honestly perfect right out of the box, I've been walking\/jogging\/running in these babies for over a month now with no problems whatsoever. I plan on buying several pairs of these before somebody decides to \"improve\" them and changes something.  Boy do I hate it when I finally find a shoe I like and then the company decides to 'improve it' and screw up a really great shoe (bitter much? gee not me)  \nI also received the shoes in less than a week and that is a miracle where I live.  Good service all around.  Hope this helps someone else."

        "reviews":"Not all bras are created equal.  But what makes it so special?  As a fuller figured female, let me explain the merits:\n\n1)Support - it does a great job. This bra does not sag over the course of the day.  Your figure looks just as great in the evening as when you put the bra on in the morning.\n2)Coverage - this gives the modest more coverage so people don't see what you don't want them to see.  For starters, the fabric is thicker than any bra that I have ever owned.  And no, this is  not a padded bra, the material is just thicker.  Since the material is thicker, it means that it is truly opaque.  Not even with the thinnest and whitest t-shirt will you be embarassed.\n3)Comfort - this bra is quite comfortable, especially considering that it is an underwire.  I have not experienced the sensation of  underwire digging in nor the straps gouging my shoulders.  But on occassion I do feel some pressure from one of the straps (hence the 4 star rating).\n\n\nNow there are a few things that may give you pause.\n\n1)Price - this bra averages $60-65 in department stores, not a cheap undergarment.\n2)Size - this bra is larger compared to other bras of the same size.  What I mean is that the bra has a defined shape... it does not lie flat as the cups are molded.  And there is more fabric that connects the cups together.  A good descriptive word is \"substantial\", but don't think bulky.  This bra does disappear under t-shirts giving you a beautiful form rather than a body marked by undergarment lines.\n\nThis is an undergarment that I intend to buy again... and again... and again"

I've been wearing bikini style for more than a decade and these are a good economical alternative to the brand that got me started, Calvin Kleins. The Calvins are the Shangri La's that all others strive for. But you got to pay. You only get one pair of Calvins for $15 and here you get 3 Hanes for $11. They are almost identical in feel, the difference is in the construction. The Hanes only have a single layer frontal sheild whereas most other bikinis will double that area up and for good reason. After about a year or so  your buddy downstairs will be busy making himself a little window and who knows what that could lead to. A door or a hatch and then he could bust out and take over. I suppose cost vs. longevity with the Calvins does balance out. They cost 4x as much but last 4x as long. But do our partners want us having the same pair of undies for more than 5 years? Maybe the Hanes are the better buy  because you will eventually have to replace them."

I canceled most of the items, only ordering a belt and a tee.  Shipping was still ~ 50% surcharge.\n     Received my order yesterday and found that the belt is defective.  The buckle is on backwards (no, it's not reversible...) plus the material of the belt itself is damaged by a frayed hole.  It isn't worth the shipping cost & hassle to send it back, I'll probably just throw it away - but I did learn something.\n     I will never deal with Andrew Christian again!

There's there's zero stretch in this, it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big. Since they're short from crotch to waist anyway, it doesn't much matter.\n\nThe top fits better, since you adjust it. The cut is still quite poor and, again, there's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders. It's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust. It's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem.\n\nIf you're narrow through the hips, shoulders or bust, this combo will probably be a nice fit. If you're curvy, you might want to rethink this. It's a shame since it comes in plus sizes. Maybe I should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit IMO"

So, my husband buttons one end of the Tiedown, slides the Tiedown through the necktie's nametag (with the shorter necktie end tucked in also) and buttons the Tiedown at the other end. I would've bet money on the fact that you could see the edges of this 'cheap' tie holder or that the tie just wouldn't lie right.\n\nWell, I was right. The tie crumpled all up and looked goofy--until we moved the Tiedown down one button. Then I had my husband stand up straight, lean forward, lean from side to side......... OMG.... I could not see the Tiedown at all, and the tie was completely well-behaved! We were thrilled with this new gadget! Hubby has worn it for a week--and has not heard one comment from colleagues about the 'unusual' tie holder. Because no one can see it!\n\nI do have one suggestion though--they should be sold in packs of three or five--that way if one gets broken by the kids, chewed up by the dog, or lost by dear hubby, then you'll have extras on hand. So, in the meantime, by a few when you order! (I didn't realize at the time of this review that a multi-pack was available).\n\nThis is a product that will eventually be sold in high quality retail shops--get them while they're still so CHEAP, because once the designers get a hold of them, they'll crank the price up so high you'll think you're buying a slice of gold instead of plastic!!

These athletic crew socks can be worn for athletic activities but of course they could be worn for everyday routine use as well. In addition, they are made from 85% Gold Toe's \"Ultrabrite\" acrylic and 15% stretch nylon. Amazon states that the acrylic gives these socks \"wickability\" but this word may be a typographical error; I could not find an entry for the word \"wickability\" in the dictionary. The price is right, too. \n\nThese crew length socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12; therefore it is--almost--one size fits all. The reinforced heel and toe makes them last longer and they still feel very comfortable on my feet. The sock itself comes in white; but the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers. \n\nI would not dry these socks at high temperatures. This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot. Eventually they could \"bunch up\" when you wear them and that's very uncomfortable. Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature. Then they will remain just as comfortable as ever. I know mine do!\n\nOverall, you can't go wrong buying these socks. They keep your feet extra warm during colder weather. They are manufactured so well that you definitely get more than your money's worth. A good deal!\n\nSMILE"

They retain their original  softness even after many washing & machine dryings.  They don't snag, run, or get stiff & uncomfortable, and they keep my body very warm, but they never feel damp or sweaty.  These are far above all other brands, but are not as costly as most of those inferior brands.  I threw all my other thermal underwear in the garbage, where they belong, after trying Lady Morgan's thermal underwear.  Excellent price for an excellent product!

The lateral support is excellent and better than I expected.  The fit is excellent and I have no slipping inside the boot (yeah!!!).  For my conditions the soles could be slightly more agressive, but they hold well.  My four pint instep crampons have a tendency to slightly roll to the inside...I think because of the shape of the sole at the instep (so I have ordered a set of six point that add 2 to the heel).

The company did a wonderful job of packaging\/shipping the product-even the buttons were individually protected. I paid for expedited shipping, but they still cut the deadline close, so I was nervous about it arriving in time. The lining on the inside is thick and bulky so it isn't as streamlined as the pic implies, and tends to make the leather bulge a bit in places. (It was lumpy-looking even in the box.) Removing the zip-out lining doesn't change this--there's significant padding in the shoulders. It's also a shinier leather than expected. Sizing chart seems a bit inaccurate--I ordered a size larger than he normally wears in coats (which is a size larger than his regular clothing), but it was still too snug in places, lining or not. Overall, though, I'd say I got what I paid for, if you don't count the unusually high shipping charges. (Even standard shipping and handling charges were unusually high compared to other companies."

In the past I've dealt with shin splints, knee pain and plantar fasciitis(a.k.a. really sore feet), but my ASICS 1100s kept me healthy and comfortable, and relatively stylish. I've been a committed Asics devotee since.\n\nI own ASICS Kayano running shoes, which cost $135 - considerably more than the GT series - and truthfully, I find no difference between the two except for the price. Also, there is not much difference within the GT series. I've owned GT-1100, GT-1120, GT-2110 and GT-2120 - all are superior. So, find the style and color to suit your budget - and enjoy comfortable running to your heart's content (or until you rack up 300 miles, after which you should replace your Asics as all running shoes start to lose their support and stability after around 300 miles. FYI - many local track clubs have programs in which they collect retired running shoes and donate them to impoverished children and adults. Spread the Asics comfort! Because though the shoes are no longer optimal for running after 300 miles, they still make great \"kick-around\" shoes and are cute and fun for casual wear.

This is a very good case overall"

        "reviews":"If you are used to Levi's or the regular Wrangler jeans, here's some help in choosing a the right fit for this. This jean is the \"slim\" version of classic Cowboy Cut jean that Wrangler has been making since 1947. Among the Levi's jeans, the fit of this jeans is most similar to that of the Levi's 512,but it is cut slimmer in the seat. It doesn't have as much orange stitching as a Levi's, the back pockets sit higher. It has a zipper fly. The so-called \"rigid denim\" looks a lot like the \"shrink to fit\" rigid denim of the Levi's button fly 501 when new and will lose a lot of indigo dye on the first wash, but that's where the resemblance ends. The 501 shrinks about 10%, but the Wrangler shrinks less than 3%, because it is Sanforized. So, you should buy your correct size, erring on the side of slightly larger if you are right on the border.  \n\nCompared to the regular the Wrangler Cowboy Cut, the this slim Fit is quite a bit skimpier. The slim fit seat is smaller and the legs are pretty trim--it's more of a boy's cut. If you are really on the thin side, it may work for you, but many men will find it too constricting in the waist and seat. \n\nWranglers stonewash finishes are pretty mainstream compared to some of the more exotic things Levi's is doing now. These definitely are not so-called \"destructed\" jeans. You won't find whiskering or abrasion the way you will on the stonewash Levi's. \n\nOverall, these are very solid well-made jeans that offer a nice alternative to the more popular Levi's models. Like Levi's, they are well made and indestructible."

        "reviews":"The Bravado Maternity\/Nursing bra is very comfortable for daytime wear, so I would highly recommend it if that is what you are looking for.  The way in which the bra opens and closes makes it very easy and comfortable, and it doesn't create strange lines under your clothes like some nursing bras do.  After the first few weeks of wearing this bra, I had no doubt that I had made the right purchase.  \n   On the downside, as others have mentioned in their reviews, I did notice that as time went on the bra seemed somewhat less supportive.  Along the same lines, this bra bothered me to wear to bed, because my breasts always seem to fall out of it.  I know I was wearing the correct size, so maybe this was due to the low-cut criss cross shape of the bra.  Whatever the reason, I found it quite irritating and uncomfortable to wrestle with my breasts in the middle of the night!!  To be fair, I had the same problem with another(different brand)nursing bra also, so maybe this is just what happens when you try to sleep in bras.  Consequently, I ended up buying a sports type bra for sleeping.    \n  Overall, because I only used this bra for daytime wear and I resigned myself to the fact that I'd have to wear breast pads with almost any nursing bra, I really liked the Bravado bra and would definitely recommend it."

The swim style is cut very low in front, with a fairly small pouch.  Not only is it great for working out under your workout pants or shorts, it actually turns out to be a very sexy pair of underwear for everyday or play.  The low rise cut pairs very well with low rise jeans, not to mention the barely there skimpy factor.  Heat it up a little and try this jock under your low cut jeans.....looks and feels hot!

Otherwise I would reccommend it to others like me - large bust and a regular or small chest.  Plus, the racer back gives women with a large bust a break from the strap marks from regular bras"

        "reviews":"Be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards.  I bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards, my ID and some cash.  Hence, there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet.  From the picture, it looks as though the business card side is just a slot. Whereas, in reality, it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders).  Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space), the leather itself is very low quality, and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it.  Furthermore, on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China.  I mean, China is great and all but if you're on a date and you say \"Hey, let me pay for this,\" and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China, well, you are pretty much a schmuck (I cut mine out with a pair of scissors, but there are still some remnants).  So if you like being low class, by all means, buy this wallet.  I personally don't care about my wallet very much so I am keeping it and going to use it, but I almost returned it.  It is most definitely a solid 2 stars.  Hope this helps"
