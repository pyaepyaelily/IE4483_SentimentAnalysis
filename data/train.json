        "reviews":"I love these shoes. These are real tennis shoes, made for tennis. That means lightweight, durable, and good for walking. They're beautiful little things.\n\nMany people do not know the full history of these Italian leather babies, but those who do know are of the upper echelon. The Ellesse name is based on the initials, L.S., of its founder, Leonardo Servadio, an Italian tailor with an innovative approach to styling and manufacture. In 1959, Servadio created a revolutionary stretch ski pant which established Ellesse among the elite alpine social circles, making it the ultimate aspirational brand.\n\nThe immense success of Ellesse in winter sports clothing provided a perfect passport to expand the brand and transfer the design philosophy into the equally prestigious world of tennis. In 1976, Servadio seized the opportunity to take the brand onto a worldwide stage and embarked on an aggressive sponsorship programme signing tennis legends such as Boris Becker, Chris Evert Lloyd and Guillermo Vilas.\n\nEllesse became synonymous with tennis and skiing and as a testimony to the success of Ellesse in these highly competitive fields, the Ellesse logo, consisting of half a tennis ball combined with 2 ski tips, surmounting the company name, was created.\n\nI must also warn that there are a few pairs in this particular line that have a minor defect, in which there is one shoe where the sole comes loose. This can be fixed with a little rubber cement, but if you don't want to be bothered, just send it back and have it easily exchanged, with the shipping costs reimbursed back to you. Even with that small hassle, you can't beat the sharply reduced price featured here!\n\nMy favorite pick is the White\/Tan\/Brown. Just be sure to keep the laces clean",

I wear a size 12 (sometimes a 14) and ordered a Large the first time. They fit perfectly, though I had to pin the part around the ankle to keep it from being so blousy. I noticed that complaint on other reviews, but it's easy to pin it from the inside and remove some of the fullness. The slimness in the hips and the comfortable fabric completely make up for the ultra-fullness at the ankle. I get compliments on them everywhere I wear them and I can dress them up or down, with flats or heels, with no problem. I did make a mistake when I ordered the second pair and got an XL. I washed them on hot and dried them very hot, as well. They actually fit fine and are really comfortable--but I'll order the Large again next time, for sure. I'm going to order all the other colors available, and maybe even a second pair in the olive green since I wear them so much. They'll never go out of style. They're perfect for airline travel because you can put your boarding pass and I.D. in the pockets, while sending your carry-on or purse through the conveyor-belt security. I love these pants!",

        "reviews":"As an advanced exerciser, I am always looking for a new, innovative challenge. The Firm Body Sculpting Ball workout provides just that. This workout comes with a sculpting ball, which is available in three weights (four, six or eight pounds). I used the eight pound variety, and by the time we got to the ab work, I was ready to put the ball away! My arms really got a workout, as did my core. There are several moves that require you to hold the ball out in front of you, over your head, and move it diagonally across your body. I could really feel it in my core after the workout.\n \nOnce we completed several segments of standing work, including grapevine, squats, and lunges, we go to the floor for bridge work and abs. You have to hold the ball between your thighs during the bridge work, which I found challenging since by that time I was sweating and the ball kept slipping away from me. You also hold the ball between your thighs to do ab crunches, which is difficult with such a heavy ball. Afterwards is a short cool down, which I thought could have been longer.\n \nTina leads, and she is very fit and quite personable. She cues well and gives a few form pointers along the way. As with all the new Firm releases, the background is sterile and boring. There are four background exercisers, with Allison showing beginner moves. Allie is holding the eight pound ball showing more advanced moves. The music is nice and non-intrusive.\n \nBeginners will enjoy this workout. It isn't complicated and with a four pound ball you could get a really intense workout. Unless you're advanced and have some good upper body strength, I would not recommend the eight pound ball. You could injure yourself if you go to heavy. In fact, I was wishing I had another, lighter ball for the floor work.\n \nI have all eight new workouts, and I've done three so far. Of those, I liked this one the best. I felt I got a good workout, but I wish it were longer. The entire workout from start to finish is about 32 minutes long. Another 15 minutes would have been great, although I suspect my arms would have been totally fried if we'd kept going much longer. \n \nOverall, I give this workout high marks. It's definitely a keeper",

I can't explain exactly how the older pair is but there is a slight look and feel of a difference. I still like the older ones better. Not sure if I'll ever find the same ones again.

        "reviews":"Like the last reviewer said it's tricky to put on using the little straps that go around your bra...that is a FACT. A front closure bra might help some. Even though I (finally and after a lot of cussing) got the straps around my bra, the garment still gapped underneath the bra on both sides of the back strap, which is right in the middle. That is the only place in the back there is a strap to hold the whole back of the girdle up. \n\nThen there is one strap under each arm that goes around your bra there. It pulled down on my bra there causing scrunching. There is one strap in front in the middle too, which I don't need to use. \n\nThe directions say to attach the Spanx\/straps to the bra and 'step' into the garment. RIGHT!! Much easier said than done.\n\nFor it to stay up properly in the back I think it needs straps not only right in the middle, but also to the left and right of the middle, in between that and the under the arm ones. I can't really use mine...A waste of money, I already removed the tags and can't send it back. I have another Spanx that is the same but without the little straps and I can't use that either, as it does creep down in the back. Unless you don't MOVE that is. So altogether I have spent about $150 for Spanx stuff I can't use.\n\nThere must be a better way to fasten those straps....maybe sturdy SNAPS or velcro or something, and they should  fasten right to the TOP edge of the garment, as it is they hook half an inch down on the inside and that causes the top edge to tend to roll out and cause bulk there.\n\nNot happy",

Keep it with you just in case, and see the envy on others faces as they shiver in their lycra or suffer the sauna conditions of wearing a garbage bag to keep dry because they didn't carry this handy bit that easily fits in a jersey pocket or any kind of backpack without too much bulk.\n\nKeeping the wind out alone is a big way to keep warm in foul conditions, while continuous riding will produce more than enough heat to keep you warm most of the time.\n\nIf you're heading out for, say, NYC's Five Borough Bike Tour in May, and don't know what to buy, your basics are: some kind of jersey--a CoolMax shirt will do; 6 panel or more cycling shorts with a chamois (pad) where the sun don't shine; light \/ thin socks (Air-e-ators are best); and one of these jackets.  These and a helmet and you're set for serious riding.\n\nSkip the bulky layers for warmth.  If you want that bit of insulation you may need, get a $10 polarfleece vest from a bargain store, and one of these jackets. \n\nI take one star because it doesn't have vented armpits, but on second thought I probably shouldn't have in consideration of the price to value ratio",

In my opinion technology has yet to replace the abilities of natural materials like wool and silk.  Of course, this is only my opinion and preference.  However, when manufactures refuse to inform and the buyer with more than \"Wool and Nylon Blend?\" there is no mechanism to a consumer to make an informed choice or even purchase what they are looking for.\n\nStretch nylon is certainly nice for form fit and ease when it comes to slipping your foot onto your sock and into your boot.  BUT - if too much nylon is present it will show its downside should the hiker or hunter find themselves in a wet situation and hiking for long periods.\n\nIt would seem that the age of the 100% wool sock is almost gone and I accept my fate, but I urge people to NOT buy a sock, which does not disclose the details of its manufacture.\n\nThe review reflects on \"full disclosure in advertising\" and not the product itself.

        "reviews":"I've been buying Land's End Sport Knit Pants for over 15 years (Land's End clothing for much longer).  They've redesigned these COMPLETELY (and are doing this to all of their women's pants).  Don't be fooled into thinking you'll be getting what you used to order.  Also, this resizing \/ redesigning of women's pants is systemic.  LL Bean is discontinuing their similar Perfect Fit Pants and having all of their pants (knit or otherwise) resized \/ redesigned.  Here's just a few of their improvements?\n\nAmong the changes:  The waist band (height\/width) has shrunk from 1.5 inches to 1.0 inches.  It now rolls!  Fun - not!\nNext, the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches (=\/- .5 inch) relaxed (when not being worn) to a whopping 28 to 29 inches!  \n\nIt was great fun to put on the ones I ordered, and even after washing them, I thought I must have changed bodies overnight.  The waist just hung.....  Dare I put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down.  When I tried walking in them, that's exactly what happened and I was constantly having to pull them back up.  I had to pin the waist to keep them on...\n\nThat's not all the changes.....\n\nThey've enlarged the bottom legs by FOUR (4) inches!  No more slightly tapered leg.\n\nThe front rise has SHRUNK from 12.5 to 11.5.  If I wanted my belly button to show, I'd go pull out a pair of my 70's hip huggers.....\n\nThe back rise has INCREASED from 15 to nearly 16 inches. Did my rear suddenly increase in size?  I think not.\n\nThey claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz.(old was 6.7 oz).  The ones I am returning are LESS substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can't with my old ones.\n\nNext, it seems they have also extended the inseam length.  It was 32 inches on the old sport knit pants before washing - about 31.5 after.  The ones I received AFTER BEING WASHED had inseams measuring nearly 33 inches.\n\nFinally, as if I wasn't feeling self conscious enough about my bod, the pants have been narrowed in the hips and thighs.\n\nDo you get the picture?  The waist sags and rolls.  The seat is major baggy.  My belly button shows.  They have to stretch across my hips so there's those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crotch.  They are sucked tight to my thighs, then ballon out from my knees to the feet.  They're too long, so you can't even see my feet.\n\nI spent 30 minutes on the phone with a \"specialist\" at Land's End and she couldn't explain why all the changes.  That's also where I got all of the above NEW specs.  Also, spoke with a specialist at LL Bean and their NEW specs are identical.\n\nI spend so much each year with Land's End that I get a gift and card at Chrismas from them.  So, I'm not a casual purchaser of their product.\n\nBUYER BEWARE AND GET THE NEW SPECS BEFORE YOU BUY A PRODUCT YOU THINK YOU KNOW AND CAN RELY ON. YOU CAN\"T.\n\nIF YOU ARE A LAND'S END or LL BEAN CUSTOMER - CALL THEM AND COMPLAIN.  THEY'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST, THEN HAD TO BRING BACK THE \"OLD\" VERSION.\n\nSO, IT WASN'T BROKE Land's End was always sold out or back ordered on their sport knit pants) SO WHOSE DIM-BULB IDEA WAS IT TO \"FIX\" THEM????",

The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies. And the velcro doesn't even stick. They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes. Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son. Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review!",

        "reviews":"Recently, I took a motorcycle trip from Atlanta, GA to Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Unfortunately, I didn't have the option of riding at night when it was cooler and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110, it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dryer set on high blowing in my face. I also didn't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so I would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down. \n\nAfter getting home, I recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket, preferrably mesh. I was amazed at how well it worked in the demo so I went online and ordered one.\n\nThe particular model I ordered from Amazon is the Deluxe Evaporative Cooling Vest in black. It came about a week after I ordered it via USPS Priority Mail. They offer several styles and colors, including some that have removable sleeves\n\nThe outer shell is quilted black nylon with 2 outside, zippered pockets and a zipper up the front. The neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snuggly around your neck if you want. The inner liner is blue and is 100% Nylon Taslan, a water repellant fabric, so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it. Out of the package, it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water, the special material, called Polymer Embedded Fabric (PEF), between the inner and outer shells absorbs water and the vest ends up weighing about 2-3 lbs. You only need to soak it for about a minute. There are spandex panels on either side that allow for some for expansion. I got the Large size and it fits great, not too tight, not too loose. \n\nOnce the water is absorbed, the instructions (on the tag in the vest) say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner liner dry. Not being like a sponge, wringing it doesn't do a lot of good so I'd suggest blotting if you need to. While the inner liner is water repellant, there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you don't soak it too long, the inner liner will be relatively dry. The material that holds the water doesn't expand like a sponge, it just holds lots of water...it's pretty interesting stuff.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice after a few seconds is that it's cool to the touch. The principle of it relies on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works. I haven't had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet, but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool. I don't think I'd like to try it in anything less than about 65 deg (F) because I'd probably freeze nor would I want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it. The inner liner stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp. The cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets, they are lined with the same material as the inner liner so they'll stay relatively dry. One thing I've found though, it'll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it. The water is very slow to evaporate but once it does, the weight goes back down to a few ounces.\n\nBottom line, I HIGHLY recommend getting one of these if you routinely ride in hot weather. They're an inexpensive way to keep cool and they're stylish (except for the hi-vis lime green). Wear it under a mesh jacket and you won't know it's hot outside.",

They feel like a million dollars and come from an esteemed Napoletana designer, Ermenegildo Zegna.\nBut, as a general rule when buying Italian clothing, *always* buy them bigger than you would expect.  I normally wear a size large shirt in the US, never XL.  I am 5'7\" and 185 lbs.  I bought a size 54 (x-large) and it is comfortably roomy, and not too \"huggy\" on the fat.   I think some of the similar sweaters from Zegna are more \"delicate\" (read: see-through).  This one is a little thicker, but still thin for a sweater.

Although they might be hard to see in the accompanying photo - both serve to give the overall garment a much more finished appearance - while also offering an attractive focal point for the eye!\n\nThe fluffy waistband on this Flutter Butt crotchless undie - also helps to accentuate your hips - by providing a little skirt-like appearance.\n\nIf you have other frilly lingerie, this crotchless knicker - by heightening the tease - might make this a very fun and memorable addition to your collection. \n\n\nFor me, my most baby-like babydoll nightie - which had a short bodice and a billowy skirt (with almost no waist) - ended up coordinating quite nicely.  It also helped that my hubby had ordered this Flutter Butt undie in \"white\" rather than \"red.\"\n\nWhen I sprang this outfit on my better-half, I also made certain to peek up at him - with my most shyly innocent (and dopey) expression - while using my index finger to seductively play with my lower lip!  (Hey, it works!)\n\nAnd \"no\" - I didn't round out my ensemble by putting bows in my hair - and by clutching a giant lollipop (by the stick) in my other hand!\n\nIf you love frilly lingerie, this Flutter Butt crotchless undie from Love Fifi may be perfect - for adding a little SPICINESS -- to your INNOCENCE!

I find it hard to find jeans that fit me right because I have a small, well-defined waist but more generous hips, buttocks, and thighs; most jeans that fit my lower half have a large gap at the back of the waist.  When I tried these jeans on in my usual size, 8, they were a bit too tight, but when I went up to a size 10, they fit quite well.  There is a *slight* gap at the back of the waist when I wear this jeans, but because the fabric has a hint of spandex, they fit my body well enough to wear without a bit.  The spandex also makes these jeans extremely comfortable; they hug my body nicely without feeling the least bit tight.  I also love the low rise, which falls an inch or two below my belly button, just where I like it, and the boot cut, which gives my short legs a wonderfully long, lean look.  I'm just shy of 5'5\", and the 32\" inseam is a bit long on me, but I prefer my jeans on the longer side these days, so the length seems just right.  Overall, these are a great pair of jeans at a great price--highly recommended, particularly for pear-shaped gals like myself",

Should it rain, the water rolls right off due to the Teflon coating.  Under the front flaps up to the neck is a netting that allows the coat to breathe and keep things comfortable inside.

Even the sizing was appropriately done in my opinion, you should be able to order whatever slipper size you are comfortable with without concern.  The only drawback (and it can be a big drawback) is the plastic cords inserted into the product to keep them together:  one was inserted incorrectly with the result the plastic could not be totally removed.  Because of that I cannot wear the slippers.  The plastic was inserted through the bottom middle of the slipper and after removing the plastic we discovered a portion of it was coming up through the slipper bed and there was no way to remove it.

They are made out of nylon so thin and wispy that it feels like you don't have anything on at all. And boy do they look good. I just can't get enough of looking at myself in the mirror.\n\nThis weekend I'm hosting a lingerie party and I'll definitely be singing praises about these panties that let you show just enough throw to really titalate.

This product is perfect for any man that wants to smell like a man, this product does not disappoint at all in that it does *NOT* smell at all like a woman's perfume. It is *ALL* man.

As a long time 505 guy, I thought their must be a lower line of jeans of Levi's that they are releasing to big chain stores, saving their Regular Levi Name for Department stores.  Well, finally I broke down to look at a pair of these jeans when I say they were on sale. I was astonished, they are exactly the same jean, for an average of $10 less.  Look closely, the stitching is the same, even the position of the inside labels. The buttons and rivits are the same as well.  The main difference is that the Back Pockets don't have that little red Levi tag, and the \"V\" shaped decorative detail stich. Otherwise these are the same jeans. They fit just as well, and I think even better, but that may be because my wallet is a bit fuller fit after buying these. After 15 years of 505's, I have found a new favorite.  Seriously, check these out, you wont be dissapointed.  Even better, they do have a kids line, so for your growing kids you can get the same levi quality for less, nice when they grow out of jeans so fast.  If you are worried about where they are manufactured, I can tell you the last 20 pairs of Levi's I have had have been made in either mexico, Columbia, or somewhere in asia, so these being made in egypt is not a big deal, at least they grow cotton their.\nNote: button fly 501 people, they do not have a line of Signature button flys, so you have to stick to regular levi's. Probably a smart marketing move, but these genes suprised me, and Levi's may suprise again",

The arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist.  The length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs.

I really recommend an invisible shield, it works better than this case for sure. This case is a bit bulky, but it's alright if you don't mind taking the player out to press the buttons to change songs and put it back in. Sometimes when you put it back in, it will accidentally press one of the buttons which can be annoying and pretty much is. Basically, if you want a case to keep it in this isn't too bad, but another product is better for sure. Either my case was jinxed or they are all like that.",

And if I run, anything heavy in the cargo pockets annoyingly slaps me in the legs (all scrubs are loose-fitting on my chicken legs).

Let's face it, cargo pockets make you look like you are ready for anything (even if I have learned how to minimize the amount of stuff I needlessly carry around).

I have tried other department store brands like Levi, Old Navy or Dickies, which wear out quickly (some even disintegrate washing them!) and I have tried more upscale, even designer brand jeans like Evisu, True Religion or Dolce & Gabbana which don't hold up to the wear and tear of everyday life.  Wranglers have outlasted them all, and on top of that, they are still cheap enough to replace easily if something catastrophic does happen.\n\nOne word of warning that really applies to all brands of jeans, however, is that the more bleached or stonewashed the jeans you buy are, the faster they are going to wear out.  If you are really looking for value, the dark dark blue jeans are the ones that will last the longest, and you may get, depending on how much you wear them, another six months to a year out of them.  The stonewashed is the \"in\" look, however, and they are still really good jeans even if they don't last as long.\n\nThere may be other jeans out there in the world that are as good as Wranglers, but I've honestly stopped looking now that I've found these.  They do the job and I am happy to wear them 308 days a year",

I mean, with the Grail, you don't have to worry about sizing.  I hesitated to order this bra for a long time, as it appears to be pretty ugly in the photo displayed here, but I am pleased to say that in person, it's actually rather pretty.  However, be aware that there are 4 hooks in the back, so forget about your amour quickly unclasping it in during a moment of passion.  These hooks and the stretchy, sheer fabric provide substantial support though, and the wide straps are comfortable and won't leave whiplash marks upon the shoulders.  Unfortunately, the bra is cut rather narrow at the upper sides, heading towards the underarms.  Depending on your build, this can mean that the sides of your breasts will squish out, which is unattractive and indicative of a poor fit, so ordering a larger cup size than normal might be necessary",

        "reviews":"I was looking for a good nursing nightgown to wear while in the hospital after giving birth to my second child.  I had seen the Aimee gown before, and I really liked the looks of it, and the reviews seemed great.\n\nAfter purchasing the gown (was shipped via Fed Ex to Canada, which means I got dinged by Fedex's \"customs broker\" costs...) I tried it on while 8 months pregnant to see how it fits.\n\nI purchased a size XL as I am around a sz 14 pre-pregnancy.  I have a normal bust size of 36D.\n\nThe gown itself is made of a nice heavyweight cotton with lots of stretch and recovery (doesn't just stretch out and stay there), the crossover top is really nice becuase it crosses over and will be easy to pull aside for nursing, but the v isn't too deep  (nobody needs to see *that* much of my clavicle).  There is a slit up the side for ease of walking, but it's a very high slit, too high, I felt. \n\nThe gown didn't fit well over my pregnant belly - but I don't fault them for that, it's not advertised as fitting during pregnancy.  However, after giving birth, I still don't think it would fit well for the first couple of weeks, until the baby belly subsides a bit.  The gown stretches well enough to fit over a slowly-declining bump, but unfortunately, as you walk around, the elastic contracts the gown back up over your bump, pulling the slit on the side higher and higher up your leg.  The gown itself is long enough to more than cover your bump as it retracts, but it's not a comfortable feeling when that slit creeps higher and higher.\n\nThe bustline will be great when I'm nursing - easy to pull over, and great coverage on the other side.  It fits well under the bust (elasticised under the cups) but I found the cups were HUGE on my breasts.  It fit well at the band, but I guess they figure if you're a big girl, you must have big boobs.  Luckily, I'm handy at sewing, so I plan to take the gown up at the shoulders to fix this.\n\nOverall, I think this will be a great gown to wear around the house while breastfeeding.... after the baby belly has subsided.  I do plan to bring it to the hospital with me, but only after I've taken in the seams at the shoudlers, and closed the side slit a bit",

Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  \n\nThe idea of \"Medium\" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32\" waist.  Is that not \"Medium\" sized? \n\nI think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  \n\nThe draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  \n\nAlso, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.\n\nI wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like \"old men's\" underwear.

        "reviews":"It's October 8th, 2006.  The Detroit Tigers have just defeated the New York Yankees to advance to the American League Championship Series.   People counted the Tigers out.  Everyone thought the Yankees would walk into Comerica Ballpark and put a serious damper on the success the Tigers have produced all season long.  Nope.  Didn't happen.  The Tigers won 95 games this year.  No one thought the Tigers advancing this far was possible, but when you have excellent stars such as Magglio Ordonez, Curtis Granderson, Ivan Rodriguez, Marcus Thames, Craig Monroe and Kenny Rogers, you can't lose.  The manager Jim Leyland also played a major part in helping to reshape the Tigers as a team, and give them much-needed direction.  He was probably the main reason they won so many games.  \n\nThe Tigers are now a team EVERYONE can love- not just Detroit fans.  TV stations are now playing Tigers games again and reminding people that yes, the Tigers are still around.  The fact that the Tigers haven't been mentioned for the last 10 years shows that the fans may have forgotten all about the team, but beating the Yankees last night was solid proof the team is back, and threatening.  Proof that the Tigers can hang with the big boys.  \n\nThe celebration after the final out in game 4 was wonderful.  Everyone on the team lifted Jim Leyland on their shoulders and proudly walked around the field, while the fans celebrated and cheered indicating they still remember those successful championship years a long time ago, and obviously still support their home team.  It got extremely crazy when the team decided to spray champagne at the audience, and they enjoyed it!  Even a cop wanted to be sprayed.  The celebration supposedly lasted an hour.  \n\nThis Vintage Crest T-Shirt should PROUDLY be worn by you.  I want you to take a trip to New York City wearing this shirt and walk down the street so everyone can see how much of a proud, loyal Detroit Tigers fan you are.  The days of watching them lose game after game are finally over.  Long live the Tigers.  Make sure you buy this shirt to celebrate the wonderful run the Tigers had in the season of 2006.  You need to wear Orange if you live in the Detroit area.",

        "reviews":"This tee-shirt is my first Under Armour purchase, and I took a chance by ordering it without ever trying on any Under Armour before.  I'm not dissatisfied, but it isn't my favorite tee-shirt.  On the positive side:  the weight of the fabric is good for exercising, especially for the gym, and it would be a good single layer for outside\/warm temperatures.   The fit is pretty good (I am average sized and wear sizes 8-10); I don't like really tight clothing and this shirt is loose enough to be comfortable but fitted enough so that it doesn't look like I'm wearing a bag.  On the negative side: I am a little short-waisted, and the shirt is long for me and bunches at the top of my hips, which I don't like but accept.  Also, the vee-neck is not a very strong vee (pictures of this shirt are true in that respect).  A lot of technical tees are like this -- designed more for function than for style maybe -- and vee-necks are essentially a crew x vee hybrid.  I prefer a true vee-neck.  Lastly, the fabric has a slightly rough, scratchy feel, which seems characteristic of today's technical fabrics.  It's not clear to me that the cost in \"hand\" is worth the added function of \"wicking\" in this instance.  Overall, I consider this shirt fine for the gym or for an hour-long run, but I wouldn't want to spend a lot of extended time in it.",

        "reviews":"I am a physical therapist.  When I got pregnant, I was concerned about my back and how it would hold up during the pregnancy.  With the hormone relaxin that is released with pregnancy, our joints loosen up and can't support as much as they do in a non-pregnant state.  This is especially notable at the sacroiliac (SI) joint of our low backs.  Instability of this joint (there's one on each side) can lead to pain.  \n\nAt about 18 weeks I started having some SI pain.  I got one of these belts and had relief within 24 hours.  For about 2 months I wore it every day to support my SI joints.  I found that if I attached the velcro strap in the front securely, but not tight, then used the two side straps to tighten up the whole belt, I would get the best relief.  I had to be certain the two side straps were even: the seam where they meet in the back was in the CENTER of my back.  I would then pull them around at the same time and attach them so that the fit was snug, but not uncomfortable.  After a couple of months, the baby started getting so big that I started wearing it more as a support for my belly.  As I've gotten bigger and bigger, I've pulled the back part upward slightly, which continues to provide SI support but also helps hold up the baby.  When I take the belt off I REALLY notice the difference.  The support is amazing for such a simple belt (wish I had the patent!)\n\nI'm due in a month.  I have had NO back pain since before I used the belt and I continue to work and exercise without problems",

The relatively snug fit ensures that these briefs will not \"bunch up\" like loose fitting boxers so often do; and many men prefer these briefs for that reason alone.\n\nThe briefs are easy to care for; they are essentially permanent press so any washer and dryer set will clean them well. They seem to last forever, too, which makes them an excellent value.\n\nIf you can, try to get these without a tag in the rear so that you won't get an itch caused by the tag. However, even with a tag you usually don't feel any discomfort. I've worn 'em that way for years without a problem. The 100% cotton fibers of these briefs add to the comfort you'll feel, too. \n\nMy only real caution--and the main reason that this product gets four stars instead of five--is that these briefs can be tight the first several times you wear them. This may be true for some of us men even if Hanes does claim that these briefs are preshrunk before they hit the store's shelves. I personally would suggest washing them once or twice just to loosen the fit up ever so slightly. Another relatively minor concern is that the elasticity of the waistband eventually does wear out. At that point you do need to buy new briefs--but, then again, nothing lasts forever, right?\n\nOverall, gentlemen who want a close fitting brief that still gives them comfort will be very satisfied with these white men's briefs.

Now, the XI can be found at significant discount. The XI is one of the best Asics has made and the XII is probably the worst.  The XII is much lighter, but less of a stability shoe and certainly not durable and not made for a heavy runner.  I hope that the XIII is more like the XI and less like the XII.

At the end, I was definately ready to put it down, so it did work me out.\nPros: Different change of pace using the ball; lots of moves that strengthen your core; a fun and different stretch at the end using the ball; Tina Smalley is a precise leader that is easy to follow.\nCons: I miss the old FIRM master instructors that were in all the other videos. Just Allie and Allison were in this one. They didn't even introduce the others. There was no changes in weight, which used to be the way to spot an \"ineffective workout\" according to the \"old\" FIRM tapes. And lastly, In my humble opinion, the ball is a little gimicky. A good 5lb weight held on the dumbell ends would work about the same. \n  Still worth giving it a shot for different days. You'll sweat, but you'll wonder, \"Is this REALLY the FIRM?",

        "reviews":"I recently got a 15\" MacBook Pro and needed a larger bag to accommodate it (replacing my Manhattan Portage 1640 Waxed Canvas Messenger Bag, which I loved). I ordered and returned several things before settling on this. I am very happy. It is a durable, smartly designed bag, and pretty much a perfect fit for the MacBook Pro, stored inside of a sleeve case. \n\nAt first I thought I would replace my Manhattan Portage bag, which was just barely too small for the MacBook Pro, with the bigger version of the same bag, the 1635. But that bag was WAY too big- the MacBook was swimming in there. This bag is a comfortable fit, with a little room on either side of the MacBook when the bag isn't too full. And there is plenty of room to carry a number of regular books (or whatever else) in addition to the MacBook.\n\n It also has an ideal number of smaller pockets - not too many, not too few - for storing accessories. For my needs, the pockets are intelligently placed and sized so I feel like there is a place for everything, and I don't feel like there are any useless pockets.  Most of the smaller pockets are inside the main compartment, on the side opposite the one that's against your body when you're wearing the bag. This makes them convenient to access while the bag is on. And one problem I had with the Manhattan Portage bag was that the smaller pockets were on the side that's against your body, so whatever was in the main compartment of the bag would get in the way of accessing the smaller pockets. Since these are on the opposite side, the pockets are easy to get to even when the bag is relatively full. \n\nOne of the pockets has a key ring, but unlike some bags, this one is attached to a long \"leash\", so the keys can actually sit at the bottom of the pocket until you need them. They don't get in the way when you are trying to get other things out, but when you do want them, you just fish them out by grabbing the top of the \"leash\". \n\nA waterproof liner was an essential feature when I was searching for a bag (I'm paranoid about being caught in a downpour with my laptop), and although this one hasn't been put to the test yet, it seems even better than my previous bag, which always kept the contents dry. One problem with the Manhattan Portage bag was that when the flap was closed there were gaps at the top on both sides, near where the shoulder strap attaches. Although this bag has a similar design, it doesn't seem to have the same problem. \n\nI do wish this bag came with a shoulder pad for the strap, but that is my only complaint and I'm sure I can purchase one separately. And the price on Amazon is significantly cheaper than I could find anywhere else, so I can put my savings toward the shoulder strap",

I picked the silver & black combination, when it shipped it was more then I expected; for the same exact thing at a local mall you would pay twice as much and that's not considering tax. The only difference between this one and other belts of similar design that I've seen is that they all seem to have logos, either engraved or cut out. I don't enjoy sporting I giant logo on my waist. I much rather get what I want AND pay less for it. \n\nThe buckle is not a design that opens and closes, rather you slip the belt through the buckle and tighten it by sliding a metal bar foward. If you close it tightly enough, it will hold a LOT of weight, far more then the open\/slip belt through\/close buckle on belt design. I carry a bunch of things on mine, including a heavy multi-tool, a knive, a phone, several pouches filled with a various manner of junk, a tape measure, and occasionally heavy construction tools. Granted the belt wasn't meant for this kind of weight but...normally after a few minutes my old buckle would just pop open from the weight...no such problem here. \n\nIt opens and closes without trouble and will fit a large waist easily.

I've tried women's stretch shirts (with spandex!) but they wrinkle into a little ball, just perfect for that pitch into the trash can.\n\nI've bought wrinkle-free shirts from Chadwick's, Lands End, Villager and others and was disappointed.  They weren't bad, but they weren't good.  If I washed them with my husband's shirts, there was just no comparison.  There were always wrinkles in my shirt.  Sometimes not wrinkled enough to have to iron them, but never really neat looking.\n\nMy friends, my quest is over.  I have found the women's dress shirt that wears and washes like a man's.  This  Women's Wrinkle Free Dress Blouse by the Foxcroft Shirt Co. has met my high standards.  I stays neat all day (even after a brisk walk in warm, humid weather) and washes beautifully.\n\nI washed it with my husband's shirts and some wrinkle free shirts from other companies.  It looked as good, if not better, than my husband's permanent press shirts and it left my other shirts in the dirt (or wrinkles, as the case may be).\n\nThe price tag is more than I usually spend, but considering the time that I will not have to spend ironing, it's worth it.

I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32\" waist.

They are comfortable right out of the box, and I can only imagine they will continue to become even more comfortable as they mold themselves to my feet.\n\nThe hand-antiqued leather offers a nice texture that works equally well with dress pants\/khakis or your favorite pair of jeans.  They slip on easily, with no need for a shoe horn, and they stay on securely, without coming loose at the heel, as some loafers are prone to do.  \n\nThis is my first pair of Clarks and I'm very impressed so far with the high quality of the leather, the comfort, and the look.  \n\nAll in all, these shoes are great.

Do not miss this great price!\n\nLike the photo implies, and like most 2(x)ist men's products, this underwear is sexy, comfortable, flattering and made of quality materials.\n\nWhat drew me to this particular pair was the bold graphic statement it makes with the contrast, specifically around the pouch area.  Believe me, it is truly a pouch.  A big one.  Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it\/filling it.  The contrast lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice.\n\nOf course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this \"no-show.\"  I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it.  Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :)\n\nFor me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show.  Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded.  But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear.  I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief\/boxerbrief\/trunk.\n\nThis pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature.  My only complaint is that the leg openings (also contrast) do not \"cling\" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc.  But that is just minor.\n\nThe waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design.\n\nI cannot reccommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection",

A year ago I bought one of these shirts in a local store and fell completely in love with it.  It's now a year later, I love it just the same, and I can't find them anywhere, except Amazon (thank God!)  The one I have just happens to have a silkscreen on it, and after a year of constant use (for work) the silkscreen still looks great.  When you compare this shirt to a 100% cotton shirt, these wear MUCH lighter & cooler, even though it says \"heavyweight.\"  Don't let that scare you as it's not \"heavy\" at all.  With constant washing over the last year, the Hanes shirt has kept its color, unlike my 100% cotton shirts of the same age which have faded much faster.  Also, if you tend to perspire, these shirts will wick away the moisture more quickly and will not show it nearly as much as a 100% cotton shirt would.  Also nice is that they don't shrink or wrinkle.  I wish I had known about these shirts years ago...  Don't kick yourself years down the road when you buy one of these shirts by accident and wonder where its been all your life (like I did), get it now and enjoy it",

        "reviews":"This wallet is fifty-fifty. The inside is great and holds cards as a wallet should. The outside, well... ...the UNCOVERED metal clip does not press against the leather so you need about 10 folded bills to get the right thickness to close the gap between the inside of the clip and the leather - less than 10 bills and expect the bills to separate from the wallet - in your pocket (ok) but not good in the open. Maximum number of bills - about 20 folded. Occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used. The metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers. If the clip is facing out - before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse, other objects. So I started facing the clip in, resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh. But `facing in' is very awkward when seated, like driving. Definitely not designed for back pockets. Why Buy: As a second wallet (one should have at least two wallets - to separate credit cards, IDs so all is not lost if one wallet is lost\/stolen. Put the small bills and one or two ONLY small limits credit cards in your back pocket wallet - pull the back pocket one out for the bandits and run away with this other wallet on you).

They are comfortable enough (maybe a little snug), but I though it was odd that they creased across (rather than to the rear of) the cap.  Within a few days, however, the skin-like coating (perhaps the waterproof layer?) of the uppers separated from the underlying leather, creating blisters in the creases.  Within a few weeks, those blisters tore, exposing the leather underneath.  I'm not sure where this will end, but at less than 2 months old, they will soon look too bad for dress wear.

But then I figured if it rains the insoles, along with my weight, would block any water from getting in the shoe.  Well I was wrong.  It had rained and the road was muddy so now a good pair of white socks have to be trashed.  The wet mud came through all the holes in the shoe including the insoles which also have holes in them.  The shoes are covered with mud now so I don't think I can send them back.",

I wanted two things: Comfort and Stability (to protect my ankles).  I tried out at least 7 different shoes.  The Asics GT-2110 felt the most natural in terms of the amount of \"give\" it had during each step.  Many others had more cushion but they felt too stiff as I launched off my toes. Previously I'd run in the 2100 shoe and (just for the record) I was very willing change brands.  In fact, I was willing to spend a lot more money to protect my knees and ankles.  Turns out it wasn't necessary.\n\nI'm running 5-11 miles per day, both on a tred mill and the road and in both conditions I'm pleased with the shoe.  I have gotten a blister in the same place with both the 2100 and 2110 (just forward of my right arch), so I'm guessing it's my foot, not the shoe.  The 2100 was giving me blisters on my toes, but after going up one size when I bought the 2110's, that was resolved.\n\nAfter a recent bad sprain (don't run in the dark!) I've been using a bulky ankle brace.  Even with the brace, the shoe has been very accomodating.  \n\nI've run in wet conditions a few times and they haven't gotten too soggy, but I've yet to find a shoe that feels \"great\" in the rain.",

This one is very wide so it should help tighten up all the skin around the abdomen and sides. Target sells a Medella brand maternity belt that looks like it will hold up for a longer period of wear than this one.  But the Medella one is only about 6 inches wide, so it looks like it doesn't tighten everything that has stretched.  I still can't wait to use this belt after I delivery to see if it helps with my recovery.",

These undershirts are made of extremely soft cotton that is just slightly thinner than your average undershirt from Hanes or the likes. The cotton is amazing - these shirts seem to last forever, and after about three washes they feel like they were made to a mold of your body. I don't know what is different about them, but unlike cheaper tee's, they come to fit you perfectly rather than just hanging flat down your sides like so many other undershirts.\n\nIf you haven't worn these before, you don't know what you're missing out on. The comfortable fit means your underarms don't sweat at all because the material fits you perfectly rather than gaping open under your arms. I really can't describe what a difference these shirts make to my day-to-day comfort.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that they are slightly hard to come by -- so once you're hooked you'll always want to have a few extras on hand.

I normally wear a 6.5 shoe, and these felt a little big when I first tried them on. However, when I tried on a size 6 shoe, I knew that was too small. I ended up buying the 6.5. I just wasn't used to having a shoe that fits AND allows me enough toe room to wiggle my toes. Merrells are great for people who need a little more room in the toebox, but who don't have feet wide enough to move to a wider shoe. These shoes are not waterproof, so you will need to treat them if you plan on hiking through wet weather. I recommend the purchase of insoles after you have worn these shoes for a few months. The insole they come with is rather thin and doesn't offer a whole lot of support. Overall, if given the choice, I would happily buy these shoes again. I would also say they run true to size for most people.",

They were all made by this manufacturer (North Pole) and had different NFL logos on them (I only bought one through Amazon, the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues).\n\nAt the first game of the season, my chair (Steelers) broke.  At the second game of the season, two more chairs (Bengals and Broncos) broke.  They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded.  They all broke in the same exact place; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked.

First of all, it gets in the way of the headphone jack, so that many times when I opened the flap, it pulled my headphones out of the headphone jack.\n\nThe part about the headphones is beyond me. You can put the headphones in the jack two ways. you can completely close the case, and the foldover flap and then put the headphones in, like when youre not going to be changing songs alot. I do this when I am working out at the gym. The second way is to have the headphones inserted with the case on but with the fold over flap\/screen protector, open. I do this in my car so if I want to change a song while driving the buttons are right there. I have never had the headphones pull out of the jack and ive had it over three months and i wear it everyday to the ymca.\n\nand then theres....\nFinally, and this is a real deal breaker, is the fact that you cannot plug in the adapter to the bottom of the player when the case is on. You have to pull the player out every time you want to sync or charge you player, which is a big hassle.\n\nthis is also not true. i didnt think it would fit right either when i got this in the mail. but it does fit. you just can't button the case closed. i can use the adapter or my wall charger(which has the same size port as my zen, thank god) while this case is on my zen.\n\nand then...\nThe case is to small for the player. When i tryed to put the player in the case it was a tight fit, when i finally got it in the case the bottom buttons on the player were being pushed down by the case. This case also adds a lot of bulk to the player as well and is very uncomfortable to use. Don't listen to anybody who thinks this product was great, they are lying.\n\nthe case does seem tight but thats how you should want it. you don't want your zen shaking around in the case do you? this case does not press the buttons down. it does take some getting used because you have to press harder to get to the buttons. but the scroll pad is right there in the open so you don't have to worry about that.\n\nI have had this case since i bought my zen. i bought it on ebay for 10 bucks. yes it does seem to add some bulk to the zen but i like it. ive dropped it twice all ready while in this case and there is no damage. it actually seems to have some shock absorbtion due to its studriness\/thickness. and people whining about the beltclip....the only time i put the zen with case in my pocket is at the gym. i put it in my pocket and the clip on the outside of my shorts. i am upside down when i do decline bench press and upside down when i do situps, it has never fallen out or even seemed like it was going to slide out of my pocket. if you care about your zen like i do this is probably the best case to get for it. best ive seen anyway. dont go for them cheap rubber\/plastic covers(you know which ones i am talking about). Also on the inside of the cover\/flap there is a \"secret\" slot where you can put money or an ID even. its sweet yes? high five!\n\npeople seem to be knit-picking this thing in alot of the reviews i've read. buy this case, and learn how to use it before you get on here and roast it all right? ive had it as long as i have had my zen and it is great no matter what you are doing.",

        "reviews":"I am a larger guy and needed a light windbreaker-type jacket with a hood that would also keep the rain off my head (that's Seattle for ya).  Since none of the local stores had these in stock I searched Amazon and found this one.  The jacket is of excellent quality and is better than I expected it to be.  It breaks the wind extremely well, and if you really need to bundle up there are velcro strips on the sleeve openings, draw strings around the waist and snaps that go over the zipper.  All in all this is an excellent wind breaker jacket.  It won't keep you warm in very cold weather, but it is one of the best light jackets I've ever owned.  \n\nWhen I placed my order on November 16, 2006 I chose 'standard shipping' and was promised a shipping date of Nov. 20 to Nov. 27.  I received the item on Nov. 27.  I can't say for sure whether I would have received it sooner had Thanksgiving day not fallen within that week, so I won't really complain about the receiving date.  \n\nMy COMPLAINT with the order, however, is this:  From the time I placed my order to the time I received the jacket, the advertised sale price DROPPED by 25 percent, $10.00.  I ordered the jacket and paid $39.95 but by the time I got it, the price was $29.99.  This didn't seem right to me.  I've written to Turfer for a resolution but have not yet received one.  If this is resolved favorably, I'll edit this review.  \n\nExcept for the price dispute, I highly recommend this jacket if you need a light windbreaker type jacket.  It will serve you very well.  Just make sure that you get the right price!! \n\nEDIT:  Still no response from Turfer on the price change, but Amazon's stated policy is that prices and availability may change without notice, so I guess it's buyer beware.  I notice that as of today the price on this item is still $29.99.  I've been using it for 2 months now and I must say it's a fantastic lightweight jacket.  I want to buy another one but I'm afraid the second I order it the price will drop to $19.99!!!",

        "reviews":"We've had this carrier for 7-8 months and have only used it to go hiking - our intended purpose - a handful of times.  We used to go backpacking a lot in our childless days and I would not say this carrier is quite as comfortable as the pack I used for that (a Gregory) *but* then again my Gregory pack has always just ridden quietly on my back and doesn't throw its weight around and yell in my ear.  I think the wiggle of the cargo accounts for the difference in comfort, and the difference is not that big.  Still, I have never hiked more than 6 miles with my kid in this and I can't imagine going much further than that.  I'm willing to admit this is due more to my going soft than poor pack design, though.\n\nWe can fit all his diaper supplies in the attached backpack if we use disposables, tie a few toys off the loops on the carrier, and stuff a sippie cup in the holder in back, and it makes for a nicely contained baby unit for a day hike.\n\nWhat I have found this pack to be unexpectedly great for is to use in place of a stroller where strollers are a hinderence - such as historical sites - or for walking around the mall or grocery store.  My kid has reached this point where he hates to ride in the shopping cart and tries to climb out, but for some reason he is happy as a clam riding up high on my back in this pack.  Generally happier than when in the stroller, even.  Never fights to get down.\n\nMy husband and I can both use this pack comfortably.  I am about 5'4 and use the pack on the second from the smallest setting; he is 5'10 and uses it maybe 2 settings bigger.  I think there are about 8 settings in all so this could certainly work well for a wide range of people.\n\nFrom a kid perspective, my boy is about 30 pounds, 35 or 36 inches, and he's riding with the seat in the middle (of 3) adjustment.  \n\nThe only thing I don't like about it is the sunshade\/rainhood, which is included with this model but makes this model more expensive than the next model down, which I think is called the Journey.  We just never use it because it wigs my kid out so we should have saved the money.\n\nI also looked at REI's child carriers, Baby Trend, and a lower priced Kelty (Base Camp, I think?) and the suspension just didn't compare.  The Pathfinder line is just much, much more comfortable.  I don't even understand why Kelty puts out carriers like the Base Camp.\n\nMy only regret is not having gotten a frame carrier sooner.  I overestimated at which point he'd be ready for one",

So these opinions are based soley, no pun intended, on my time with them so far.\n\nOriginally I had gotten a pair of the Jordan Hoops Low.  I loved the style and got a good deal on them.  Well, I found out that 13 in Jordan is more like 11 or 12 in other shoes.  So I had them returned for a 14. I got the 14's and they were long enough..just not wide enough.  It was then that I found out most of the Jordan b-ball shoes are pretty thin width.  \n\nI told the guy that I am willing to look at what they have in the store to just get something that I can try on.  I ended up trying the KG A3 and they felt nice.  I tried on these T-Mac 6s next and they feel better than the KGs overall.  The KGs felt better on the heel, but that was the only place.  Everywhere else, the T-Macs are more comfortable and it is the perfect width.\n\nJust on the shoe...they are hurting my feet just a bit..but that is common for me for the break in period.  I am overweight and flat footed so it takes a while for me to get my shoes comfortable.  They are also warm inside. I am just wearing normal cotton socks right now, not my new Jordan dri-fit socks which wick better. I notice that there are no ventilation holes on the the shoe like most have.  None on the toe area..none on the tongue..and none on the sides.  There is also no meshy fabric to help ventilation either.\n\nOne thing I worry about is the \"stability system\" on the bottom of the shoe.  Long term..it seems like it would be like the Shox system.  My local shoe expert says he gets many returns for Shox that have been torn or worn at the Shox part prematurely but never had any T-Macs back yet.  I guess we will see",

I've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red Wing. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Pros - The wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing\/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn't track into the house after doing chores outside. The moc toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers. \nCons - The wedge sole doesn't offer much traction for serious hiking on steep, loose surfaces (which I've used them for, but for which they really weren't intended). Gravel will roll right out from under them. None of the several brands I have owned were water-resistant at all. Walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly, as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. We used to say \"Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains\". So, perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the Pacific Northwest.\nSpecifically, the Wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box. They have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style, a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support. The color was actually more of a brown clay, rather than what I would call tan. The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good, actually better looking stitching than my Red Wings. However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick, however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot, thinner even than in many suede sneakers. While my ankles were covered, they didn't feel at all supported or protected.\nAfter considering for a couple of days, I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon, The Sportsmans Guide. They had provided a return shipping label in the box, so I taped the box closed, applied the label, and took it to the Post Office. I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package, and a notice of a credit applied to my account.\nSo, while I'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received, I do give good marks to Sportsmans Guide for a quick and relatively painless return. \n I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6\" Farm and Ranch boot, with wedge sole, also available through Amazon.

For the first couple of weeks I kept sticking my hand in my pocket to make sure it was still there - it's that unobtrusive.  It's made out of soft, thin leather (so thin, actually, that the embossed lettering on my credit cards shows through the surface).  That might affect the durability, but it certainly keeps the overall bulk of the wallet down.  The illustration shows a large embossed crest, but mine arrived with only discreet lettering saying \"Dopp\" at the bottom - a significant improvement, in my mind.  The wallet has pockets for 3 credit cards and a little pouch, open on the top and one side, to hold your cash.    There's also one additional pocket that's ideal for other documents you just have to carry.  The only slight negative for me was the caramel-colored vinyl lining of the cash pocket.  I don't know why they used such a low-class material there.  It's invisible from the outside, and not really offensive, but if I could change one thing, that would be it.

Most importantly, the bra supports and yet has smooth lines under silky clothes and the front dips below the waist so you don't have that sausage roll effect where the abdomen bulges when the bra stops.  Another plus is that it comes with clear straps you can use for extra support.  I only have 2 negatives.  First, I believe the ad said it came with both clear AND straps to match the bra but when it arrived only clear was included.  (I didn't pursue this.)  However, the biggest negative is that the cups are not just lined but padded.  I personally find that makes the bra less useful and can even disturb the lines of some clothing.

I contribute time as well as money to what I believe in and time slipping a bracelet on and off doesn't count.\nI have a daughter-in-law who does relay walks and other fund raising activities while she wears her yellow bracelet.

No; not just the same brand but the very same two breast pads I brought to the hospital when I gave birth.  These things are the coolest things.  As long as you keep them clean, they will adhere to the breasts and stop leakage just as the description promises.  \n\nFurthermore, these are also great if you are planning on returning to work while pumping\/ continuing to nurse.  They are very thin and the profiles are smooth so you won't have to worry about that bulky\/ obviously-nursing look which ruins many a beautiful blouse.\n\nAt first I had a little problem getting them absolutely clean but I then I used my body glove to scrub them while I was in the shower and voila!  I have not been tempted to write another review of any other products I have but I just can't believe more women have not discovered the wonder of these things.  \n\nAnother possible drawback is that the pads by nature don't allow for air circulation.  I suggest removing them for as long as you can for a few hours a day so the skin around your nipples can breathe... Removing each pad after a feeding works well for me but you will know what works best for you.  In any case; take a look at the price.  That's all I have spent on pads in 8 months.  What a bargain and an even bigger convenience.  Kudos to the makers of Lily-Padz.  A great shower gift too if you know someone who is expecting to breastfteed",

I wore them daily while walking everywhere I went in Europe. Then I wore them daily while walking miles a day in the advertising business. These shoes have never let me down. The only thing I had to replace was the shoelaces - one time.\n\nI never felt out of place wearing these shoes. Never did I feel that I was too formal in these shoes, nor too casual when meeting clients or attending formal dinners. My so called \"casual\" sneakers got demoted to strictly playing tennis after I bought these shoes.\n\nAs for the comfort, my feet have probably been spoiled because of these shoes. Even if I have to work 16 hour days my feet are still fine. For as much as I've worn these shoes and worked 80 hour weeks in them, the shoes still don't have an odor to them other than that of well worn leather (and it's barely discernable). I've never applied anything to the shoes, save for shoe polish.\n\nI'm having to buy my second pair now because my first pair I've worn out after owning them for almost 5 years. The top of the shoes are fine, only minor abrasions are visible if I don't polish the shoes once in a while. It is the soles that are wearing out, I've worn them down to almost nothing.\n\nI was very lucky to discover Bostonian and I believe I'll never have to hunt for comfortable shoes again that also look great",

I am glad I did.  You can tell how well made they are right out of the box.  They are extremely comfortable to wear, and the footbed is firm but soft.  The longer you wear them the more comfortable they get.  I like the birkibuc material better than leather as it seems to be more water resistant.  The arch is solid and in just the right spot for proper support.  The part where the strap is attached to the sole is seamless and very well done.  \n\nI am very happy about purchasing the sandals and I recommend them highly.  Your feet won't hurt wearing them all day like some sandals or flip flops.  One thing to watch out for, it says the size measures true but the first pair I ordered were much too big and I had to send them back for a smaller pair.  I used the conversion chart the seller has, but you may want to order a half or full size smaller than you normally would.

I've been reasonably happy with the Bravado line in general -- they hold up very, very well, stay comfortable, and remain supportive over time-- but I just wasn't fond of the sports bra styling of their original one.  I am often between bra sizes (between 34 and 36, between B and C cups, depending on the maker) and due to a habit of nursing more on the right side than the left, often have one breast larger than the other.  The 36C fits me very comfortably with no noticeable bunching,lines, or that nasty \"spillover\" when it's been too long between feedings.  I wear fairly fitted cotten shirts just about every day of the year so it's really important to me to have a bra that fits smoothly.  The only other nursing bra that I've found that works as well under t-shirts is a Mimi brand one that it costs just about as much, but doesn't hold its shape for very long.  Basically, this is a comfortable bra that is easy to use and will last",

There is also no arch or foot support inside the boot itself. There is a piece of leather saying \"Made in China\" and that's it. The tag even reccomends getting some sort of insole. The worst part is that on the tag of the boot it states that you should get the next size up than what your normal boot size is. The seller did not state this fact.

This bag would be horrible for a high school student, who might have to drag home texts for six classes.\n\nOf most messenger bags, the Elefunk bag is probably going to be your best choice, cause of its size and number of compartments. We have 3 of these bags, 2 of which are used for education, and the third is used as a utility\/diaper family bag. For education, as I stated before, it's best for college students. The main compartment is spans out and can hold 2 college texts, binders, and study guides snug. Keyword there is snug, cause it's not big enough to carry more. Inside the main compartment is a little sleeve held tight by a velcro patch. I use this to keep my study guides from my texts. Okay, next comes the the front pocket attached to the main compartment. This compartment is big enough to fit my 12 inch iBook in a neopreen cover, or a 13 inch MacBook bare. Warning, if you place your MacBook in this pouch, careful how you toss this bag around, cause it offers no padding and is very unforgiving. Inside this front pouch is a zippered sleeve fine for putting loose change or maybe id cards or what not. Next to the zippered sleeve are two pouches for pens and pencils, even a TI calculator, that is if you're not planning on putting your notebook in that pouch. Don't worry though, cause attached to that pouch on the outside are two zippered compartments opposite one another to the front pouch. On one side I put my black leather data file, and on the other side, I put my TI-89 calculator. Then that leaves the flap, which is secured to the bag using strong plastic clips. On the front of the pouch is a zippered compartment. Which I pretty much can only use it to pack up a couple magazines to read, if I'm waiting between classes. You can also use it to pack up headphones or earbuds, to listen to you iPod or whatever. As for the shoulder strap, it's about as comfy as it's going to get. Keep in mind, you're lugging 20 to 30 pounds of books and supplies, it's not suppose to feel like a Chinese massage. But I can't complain.\n\nAs for a family bag. Eh, I wouldn't suggest this to a newly mother who wants to go down to a mall. Cause stores will not let your take this bag in there. But if you're on a trip, or going on a flight, this bag is excellent. You can pack away all your babies needs, and other essentials.\n\nAnyway, I just didn't like seeing a product I use, and like, getting knocked, cause a couple people misjudged how to use it properly. Again, if you're taking more than 2 or 3 classes at a time, this bag isn't for you. But if you're a run of the mill college student, who takes a class or two at a time, then goes home. This bag is a must",

        "reviews":"This is a very comfortable jockstrap that's perfect for jogging as well as normal everyday wear.  I've worn it as regular underwear and found that the comfort level & support is excellent.  Normally I like to wear the Jockey Next-to-Nothing thongs, but need more ball support when I'm jogging on the treadmill.  The front pouch conforms to your bulge perfectly and has the right amount of fabric to completely cover & cup your balls, unlike other thongs and jocks on the market that leave some uncovered space.\n\nI love the textured look and feel of the ribbed mesh pouch while the support is consistent and comfortable.  The thin colored waistband offers a great look when compared to the excessively wide waistbands of other jocks.  The straps that go around your cheeks give you the same feel as other jocks.  Just keep in mind that the straps of a jock offer a different feel from that of thong-type underwear, so it may take a little getting used to if you're not accustomed to wearing a jockstrap.  All in all, this jockstrap by Bike offers the most when it comes to support, look and feel.",

        "reviews":"This is a product that every breastfeeding mother needs to know about. Finally a solution to leaking and a way to sleep without wearing a bra! I've been using lilypadz for about a month now and I must say that I LOVE them. When I started breastfeeding my daughter I was using the traditional round cotton pads that you have to put inside your bra to soak up leaks. I hated them because they look terrible under a snug fitting shirt, they don't always absorb all the liquid, and they can shift out of position leaving you with no protection at all. I assumed it was just a necessary evil to breastfeeding because I didn't know something as wonderful as lilypadz existed!\n\nI have to admit, when I first saw them advertised I was skeptical. I didn't think they would stick, I didn't think they would stay in place, and I thought for sure if they did stick that it would hurt to take them off or they'd leave a tacky residue on my breast. I hestitated for a couple of weeks, wanting to try them, but afraid that I'd spend all that money and end up disappointed. It was one morning after waking up soaked because one of my cotton pads slipped during the night I decided I would risk it and order them. \n\nWhen they arrived I read all the instructions and was ready to try them out. Now this is the embarrassing part... in the instructions it specifically says to take them off the plastic dome before using. For some reason I thought they meant take them out of the plastic container. I didn't realize that EACH lilypad was also stuck on a piece of plastic!  When I first tried to put them on I actually tried flipping the entire pad and the plastic dome inside out. (yes it was tough to do too!!) I was frustrated because they obviously didn't stick. I began to think that my fear of them not working was true. Once I realized my stupid mistake, I peeled them off the plastic and tried again. They stuck perfectly!! Try and avoid having the problem I did.. make sure you peel each of them off their little plastic domes. \n\nI was immediately surprised at how secure they felt. I knew right away that I would be able to wear them to bed and not have to worry about one falling off. My next fear was removing them. I carefully lifted up an edge and peeled one off. I was surprised that even though they stuck securely, they peeled off with ease and without causing pain to my tender breasts. I was estatic! What a great product!!\n\nI have found after using them for about a month that there are pros and cons. However the pros greatly outweigh the cons. This is what I have found...\n\nPROS\n------\n1) Attaches securely\n2) Removes with VERY little or no pain\n3) No residue left behind on the breast. Baby can eat as soon as a pad is removed. \n4) Protects tender breasts from rubbing against clothing or sticking to cotton pads. (If you are feeling sore these are a HUGE help.)\n5) Secure enough to stay on all night long without wearing a bra. \n6) Washable and reusable\n7) Invisible under snug fitting shirts. \n8) When properly applied you will not leak\n9) Peace of mind \n10) Quick drying. After cleaning them give them a good shake and you are ready to reapply them (even if they are a bit damp still). No need to buy more than one pair unless you need the peace of mind of a back up. One pair will work and will always be ready to use. \n\nCONS\n-------\n1) If not properly applied you might leak. You must be careful to avoid air bubbles and make sure you apply strong pressure to the nipple when putting them on. However, even if you leak - it won't get on your clothes. Instead it pools up around the nipple. It usually stays sealed. You just have to be sure to remove the pad, drain the liquid, rinse them and then reapply properly. One warning, if you have an air bubble and you leak A LOT it is possible for the pad to loosen and pop off spilling milk on you. This has only happened to me maybe twice after a long night of leaking while sleeping. I leaked during the night, woke up and was feeding the baby from one side without checking to see if I had leaked on the other. My milk let down filling the air bubble more and the pad popped off drenching me.\n2) If you own cats\/dogs... keep them AWAY from the pads when you aren't wearing them. They attract fur like crazy. If they do get furry its OK because it does wash off. Its just a pain in the butt and takes a little extra effort\n3) Takes a little more effort to reapply the pad in public (vs shoving a cotton pad back in your bra) but once you get the hang of it, it woudn't even make the con list anymore.\n4) I personally don't wear them every day. I'm one of those types that thinks skin should have a chance to breathe a little. I DO wear them every night, but during the day I'll occasionally wear my  cotton pads so my skin can breathe. I'm afraid that I'll end up with thrush or just pruney nipples if I wore them 24\/7. I have no evidence to back up the claim - they may work just fine 24\/7. I'd say I wear them 3-4 times a week during the day. I will NOT go a night without wearing them though because I hate wearing a bra to bed. \n\nAs you can see the pros outweigh the cons by quite a bit. The cons shouldn't be enough to keep you from trying them yourself. Even if you plan on wearing them only at night they are well worth the cost. If you are like me and you are skeptical - don't be. These really do work and you will be glad that you gave them a try. Every breastfeeding mother should own a pair and I think they would make a WONDERFUL and unique baby shower gift!",

In any event, if you can't get a sale item that you like better than this at Orvis.com, you'll at least feel you got a halfway decent price for this thick, warm, and surprisingly good-looking sweater.  While not made in Ireland, it has that sheep-yarn-crofter-whiskey-handmade look, and you can lie about its origin with ease.  THe medium heft fits its design and function, and the colors coordinate well: You will not look garish or overdressed.\n\nIn short, it's one of their few patchwork type items that really works (another being the \"Irish cap).  For examples of this concept taken to a ridiculous extreme, look for the patchwork Madras, as just one example.  While you're at it, find the corduroy pants with the dogs on it. It's \"country gentleman\" on steroids; the Hamptons after a few too many ethanol teas.\n\nBut this is a good one...you'll like it. PLease note two things: THe back is not patchwork but a tan-beigy solid (that's ok), and while it's machine washable, it's best to hand dry it or dry clean to prevent shrinking and wear.",

        "reviews":"I am technically a 32JJ (per some lingerie store lady), but have worn 34 DD and DDD since high school (I'm 27 now) and have been on the hunt for a good nursing bra (33 weeks pregnant today). I tried the \"Medela Seamless Underwire Full Fit Nursing Bra\" in a 34G and 34H. This one is the most supportive, but is an underwire (which after 8 hours, I can't wait to take off - and I've always been a committed underwire wearer) and the H cup fits, but I'm nervous about if it will fit once my milk REALLy comes in. I also tried the \"Fancee Free Foam Support Soft Cup Nursing Bra,\" which I also got in a 34G and 34H is not the most supportive, but is comfortable (i wear this one to bed, around the house, etc.).\n\nSo, regarding the Goddess bra - I just got a 34G and yes, the cups are a little big, which I'm so thankful for because that will certainly allow for some growth and they aren't so big that my breasts look silly through shirts. Not to mention, the cup part that is looser is mostly around the nipple (I've been instructed to begin wearing a nipple shield, so it allows for room for that so-not-inconspicuous item to be). My favorite part is the back portion, which is a stretchy cotton and does not dig into my ribs by the end of the day like the others. It is also pretty supportive, maybe a 9 out of 10 in supportiveness compared to the Medela - but steps above the Fancee Free. I will likely buy one more G and an H in this style - and call it a day on buying nursing bras because I finally found what I'm looking for. I'd recommend buying one that is a cup size below what you normally wear if you're looking to wear it right now and you may have to wear a size up after milk comes in.\n\nThis bra really got me excited - enough that after 4 years of ordering from Amazon, this is the first review I was ever compelled to write. Hope you find the same success with this bra, too. Good Luck",

(The last of these turned some heads, but they were cool enough that--in a situation where some rough characters were afoot--nobody bothered me.) They are awesomely comfortable. My tour guide in Israel was stupefied by them when I demonstrated the following: flex your knee, raising your calf until parallel with the ground, keeping your foot perpendicular to the ground, and--even without having to clench your toes--the clog WILL NOT fall off. Eytan watched spellbound as I did this over and over. The secret? You'll notice that your foot gets slightly wider behind the metatarsal heads and then narrows again in both directions (phalangead AND calcad, as podiatrists might say). The Boston is so expertly crafted--and so balanced for an anatomically perfect foot--that the material will stretch just wide enough to admit those protuberant metatarsal heads, then spring back just tight enough to hold them in place.

I have had several pairs of Skechers sneakers and expected these boots to be comfortable (at least nearly so). Yet the right boot's footbed is clearly not manufactured correctly, as I can barely go an 8 hour workday wearing them. It feels as though there is a hump under my smaller toes. My foot also seems to pronate markedly. The left boot doesn't seem to suffer from the same defect. They also have very \"hard\" cushioning...I can't imagine them being worn in a work environment -requiring- boots.\n\nAlso I've had the boots less than a month and the laces are starting to fray where they contact the eyelets.\n\nI should probably return them as defective, but the extra shipping fee makes that cost prohibitive",

Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  \n\nThe idea of \"Medium\" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32\" waist.  Is that not \"Medium\" sized? \n\nI think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  \n\nThe draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  \n\nAlso, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.\n\nI wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like \"old men's\" underwear.

        "reviews":"Yoga mats come in three basic thicknesses. At 1\/8\" this mat is of average thickness. Mats that are about half a thick as this one are good for travel or placing under a thicker mat to provide more traction. The thick mats (3\/16\") are about 50% thicker than this one and are designed for those who need or want extra cushion. At 24\" x 68\" it's of average length and width.\n\nThese mats are really beautiful! As a professional, I'm normally not concerned with the look of a mat; it's performance and ease of use are of primary concern. However, these mats are stunning! You'll definitely get oohs and aahs from your fellow yoga enthusiasts when you roll these out. The blue one looks like the ocean and the orange on looks like liquid lava! I especially love how the design goes all the way through the mat and isn't just 'printed' on one side. The design on your mat will last as long as your mat will. \n\nThere are two sides to this and nearly all yoga mats. Look carefully at the 'bumps' on each side of the mat. The larger bumps are designed to face upwards to cushion your hands, feet, and knees during poses while keeping your body from dangerously slipping out of alignment. The smaller bumps are designed to face downwards to grip the floor and keep the yoga mat from sliding. Many mats have a label on one end with the name of the brand. This is typically, but not always, located on the 'up' side. The bumps will tell you for sure. \n\nThis yoga mat will increase in softness and stickiness with use. (So do most mats.) They start out mildly sticky and increase in stickiness the more they are used. You will want to wash your mat when it first arrives so as to remove the thin film they get on their surface during the manufacturing process. Instructions for washing the mat are included. Once you've washed and dried your mat you're ready to begin! After using it for a while, if you find the mat decreasing in stickiness each time you pull it out, this is the typical sign that a light coating of dust or too much body sweat has accumulated on your mat and it needs a light hand washing with very diluted soap and water. After washing, roll your mat in a thick towel to squeeze out the excess water, otherwise it will take forever to dry in the air. Then, air dry your mat unrolled, inside, and away from sunlight. (Hanging over the shower bar works nicely.) \n\nWhen you first unroll your mat you will find one end to be a bit curled. Simply alternate the direction you roll your mat (top outside once, then bottom outside next) or the end you start from (curled end once, flat end next time) and you'll find it straightening out more or less over time. \n\nI recommend buying your own yoga mat even if your yoga studio or gym provides them for you. I've worked in many studios and gyms over the years. Sometimes management has mats cleaned often, sometimes not. If you bring your own mat you always know where it's been. :o) Plus, owning your own mat may encourage you to begin valuable practice at home. \n\nFor my students who have trouble with their knees in some of the poses requiring the body weight to rest on a knee, I recommend temporarily folding over one end of the mat to get double cushion under the knee while still leaving one layer under the rest of the body. This saves you having to haul more than one mat out each time you practice which can be discouraging especially to the beginner.",

It seems like as soon as he gets in he's in his own little cozy womb-like world and he just drifts off... It can be hard on the back in the shoulder blade area, as well as on the shoulder if used for a long stretch of time, but keeping the two layers as spread out (vs. bunched up) as possible generally remedies the problem.  It's easiest (I think) to put the baby in if you guide their head in first, and it's also easy to switch shoulders or the hand baby in sling to another person.  This is our most used piece of baby gear by far - my husband even gardens with it on!  Our son has loved it since he was 4 days old - he's 2 mos now and 15 lbs and there's still plenty of room for him in it. Also, it works well to breastfeed baby while they are in it which is an added bonus when you are out and about.

I felt like I had to keep tugging it up, but it just felt saggy, it didn't look saggy.  This may be because the back of the unitart is a pretty low V shape to accomadate most back styles of dresses.  I think adding velcro to the bra and the inside of my dress will solve this problem.  Also, the two pieces of boning on the sides poke my waist in rather unnaturally.

        "reviews":"I have used this clothesline all over Europe and South America on multiple trips, and I love it.  No clothespins are needed, because you can attach your clothes inside the braid of the rubber.  It packs up into almost nothing and weighs almost nothing.\n\nYou take one end of the clothesline, wrap it around something, such as a pipe or a bedpost, or even a doorknob, and loop it through itself.  You then take the other end of the clothesline, along with a small hook (you have to get one separately), and hook it to itself.  \n\nThis can hold a lot of weight - I've had two pairs of wet jeans along with 2 pairs of wet shirts, socks, and underwear all on the line at the same time.  Sure, it'll sag, but it's no problem.\n\nDon't get any of the clotheslines that have suction cups on the end - what if all you have around is wood and concrete?  Then there'll be nothing to suction the cups to.  You can't really hang your clothes to dry in a bathtub when you share the bathroom with other people..",

Now, I wear an 11 narrow so I only paid 59 bucks for these and this fact does affect my review.\n\nI sold shoes for several years and learned what good shoes are and where they come from. Generally, Italian shoes are a safe bet but I tend to buy Swedish, Spanish or Brazilian because of the uniform quality. Let me tell you, Brazilian leather is some of the finest and rivals Spanish leather.\n\nThese shoes arrived and I wore them to work the next day.  I chose the CHILI color which didn't disappoint right out of the box. Mimimal soreness which is a good sign and also very light creasing on the uppers which made me happy. \n\n A minor gripe which is not aimed solely at Bostonian but does anyone welt their shoes anymore? Welting is usually the surest sign of quality and easy to discern. Welting is simply sewing through the sole of the shoe. It is faked often so beware of rubber welting.\n\nThe heel is stacked on this shoe and  it seems a good laminate job. Stacking adds stability and oomph to a heel so always go for it when you can.\n\nThe leathers on this shoe are very good for the price and display a nice patina and richness. Not quite top notch shoe leather but above-average for this range. \n\nThe stitching is very nice with no defects on either shoe.\n\nThe overall profile of this shoe is handsome and sleek -- just the way I like my oxfords. The finish is rich and deep. I received several compliments on them around the office which always helps!\n\nAll in all, I have more expensive brown oxfords in my closet but these babies are just as comfortable and attractive not to mention cheaper.

        "reviews":"At 6 1\/2 months old my baby isn't walking yet, but when we go out I put these on her feet with our without shoes. She moves her legs a lot and usually kicks off any shoes and socks on. These stay on better than any we've tried. She can't pull them off easily. They are holding up very well in the wash and the  colors match the colors used in baby's outfits on the market - which is very nice. The \"non-slip\" part is the printing on the bottom of the feet that says \"Loveable Friends\". It is a soft rubberish kind of printing that feels very nice to the fingers. We started using these when our baby had just turned 5 months old and they stayed on just as well then. They seem like they will fit her for another few months. Overall these are very nice socks for a good price. I highly recommended them.",

I also needed something that wasn't so thick it would cause me to sit off-center and create back pain. This wallet performed as expected, took care of both problems, and looks good! The only two downsides are that it's a little too tall for standard depth pants pockets. This just means that I have to be a little more watchful that it doesn't fall out or get stolen ... but keeping an eye on my wallet is always a smart idea! The only other problem is that dollar bills are not easily moved into our out from the side pockets. It's as if the pocket is the exact same length as the dollar bills themselves, which makes quickly stowing and retrieving money a little cumbersome. My solution was to just lay the money over the cards and close the wallet on it. It now makes access to my money even easier, and I have had no problem with anything falling out.

Bean, Fox Racing Inc., and Timberland (and Barney's New York for that matter) stock up on great, genuinely tough, useful, comfortable, and attractive clothing like these shorts--and everything else Carhartt makes.  These are clothes that make you feel and look good (\"comfort clothes\" you might say) while you're rolling around in the dirt or even on your living room floor.\n\nI laude the previous reviewer's honesty in saying they're great for wearing without underwear in the hot weather, because they really, really are.  Jeans \/ denim and most cotton cloth can get hot, and that can be  real uncomfortable particularly for a man's 'bait and tackle;' whereas this cloth breathes exceptionally well.  They're particularly great for after doing endurance sports and taking a shower--when you're body is still all reved up--as a loose, comfortable cool-down clothing that you're fine wearing the rest of the day.\n\nThe pockets and loops are also very handy, not only for working on a car, bike, or doing construction, but also plenty big enough to carry your cell phone (even my Treo), keys, and wallet comfortably without being like those huge, ugly military-style thigh pockets.\n\nI expect Carhartt might someday start marketing itself just like other great, functional brands that went hip-hop style or suburb\/country sheik, and if they do it will be a real loss.  But for now at least we can enjoy another in that long series of brands that became famous for function before it was popularized as a suburban teenager fashion and then ruined.",

I wear mine while walking around chicago, or cycling to and from work and school.  The bag isn't much heavier than a \"non-solar\" bag.  Infact, once i put all my school books in it, i couldn't tell the difference between the weight of this one and my old bag. Even in the cold chicago winter, i can get a charge on a relatively clear day.  (i.e.  it doesn't have to be hot outside, just sunny.)  Also, be aware that this bag has a battery that stores the power you collect until you're ready to use it, some other manufactures have no battery, which means that you have to be in the sun when you want to charge something.  I didn't purchase my bag through amazon, (though i must say i'm thrilled that they are carrying it now.)  I dealt directly with voltaic systems, and their customer service is on point.  i hope this review was helpful to you",

This is ok at home, but try using this in the car (if you want to charge while you listen); it falls out with every turn you make.

I did this workout one time with the 8 lb. ball and have not been able to do any kind of exercise since. I am entering my second week of taking pain killers for my messed-up lower back. There are several segments (including ab work) where the ball is held with straight arms and moved from the down position to up over the head as well as twisting side-to-side. While doing these moves, I kept thinking that they really did not seem sound for that much weight. Sure enough by that evening I was dying! Perhaps they'd be ok if you used the lightest weight ball. I am in good shape and have actually been doing the P90X extreme workouts. I am accustomed to using 20-40 lb. weights and do Tae Kwon Do and I do not have any back problems. I snatched this up when I finally found it for a good price and did it on an off day. Just be forewarned-it is really easy to hurt your back with this workout. I LOVE ALL the other Firm workouts but will never do this one again. Additionally, when I received this from Amazon the ball was misshapen & the DVD case was broken from the weight of the ball. They immediately sent a replacement which was damaged in exactly the same way",

I ordered a medium. And I'm wearing it right now. The sleeves are plenty long enough, and there is a generous amount of 'give' in the shoulders. I'd say that this shirt almost runs true to size, although a medium certainly doesn't hug me like the medium-sized Brandon Thomas grommet jacket does. A large size in this shirt would have been far too big for me. I probably could have gotten away with a small, but I like this shirt being bit loose. I can wear a shirt underneath it without it being too snug.\n\nThe quality of the shirt (which could really be used as a light jacket) is quite good. It isn't lined, but it is soft to the touch and warm. It snaps closed, so no loose buttons to worry with. \n\nI like it! It isn't tacky-looking in person, but it's definitely different. If it goes on sale again, I will buy another color",

The inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through, I would have preferred an opaque white, but it did not look terribly bad with the green, though blue, red, or any other color than green would have been better with the black I had not the inital foresight to picture this. I was still pretty happy at this point. The hip-clip was removed right away, I have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 (portable speaker)  without taking it out of the case, eureka, this case did that, without the clip of course.  The lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the iPod nano, so that I would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost.  Well, I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off. Unitl, I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case. Now, despite the fact that this is the \"Aluminum\" iSkin Duo, this was not the case at all.  The green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look.  Okay that was still acceptable, until, I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off, sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away. That was it, that was the broke back camel inducement, and now I am the proud owner of a case that I will never be happy with. At first I had been all excited, and was considering the purchase of other colors, not now, this in my consideration was a waste of money.

The small zippered pouch is nicely configured for holding extras like batteries, extra memory sticks, etc, with the padded pouch and a webbed rear wall with velcro to secure the webbing -- giving two practical accessory sections. \n\nThe belt loop is well made, strong, well secured, and doesn't have velcro or snaps (which I hate, since I fear losing the camera that way), so this thing will stay on your belt, worry free. The zippers appear strong, and don't bind or act sticky. \n\nIt feels light and fits comfortably to my side or back via my belt. It is reasonably attractive as such bags go, especailly for the low price.  The display cardboard it came mounted on (I bought mine at a discount store) said it had a lifetime warranty, and it looks like it was made with a LONG life in mind).  The padding appears sufficient all around to resist normal bumps, etc.  (though I would fear a drop on concrete). \n\nI actually bought this to hold my tiny memory stick based MP3 player, and related accessories (I already have a similar bag for my camera).  When my Creative Muvo player's el-cheapo case that came with the player cracked badly and I feared it breaking completely, I wanted a cheap, durable, reasonably sized case.   I really wasn't able to find ANYTHING made for such a player.  Then I looked for small camera bags, figuring if I could pop the earbuds in with the winder and a couple extra batteries, I was set.  \n\nNow this is what I carry my MP3 player in.  It is easy to carry 1 to 5 extra AAA batteries and the player and the earbuds and winder.  The player stays dry, padded, and secure.  The very versatile zipper (two zippered tabs to leave any zipper hole where you want, and as big or small as you want) for the large pouch makes it perfect to let the earbud cord peek out without fear of any rain getting in. \n\n\nI think if you have a SMALL digital camera OR a SMALL MP3 player, and care more about functionality, durability, and a VERY reasonable price than the latest fashion fad -- you can't go wrong here. \n\nThe only three (small) drawbacks for tiny MP3 player use I can see are:\n\n1). I used a piece of bubble wrap to pad the player in the large pouch.  It was actually a bit big for the small pouch, and would flop around a lot in the big pouch. \n\n2). Of course, you can't get to the player controls when it is secured in this case.  This doesn't bother me as I generally just turn it on, adjust the volume to the circumstances, pick the music I want, close the pouch, and enjoy my music.  IF however, you want to fiddle with the player controls a lot, you WON'T like this solution. \n\n3).  Instead of a custom-made hole for the headphone\/earbud cord, you need to use a zipper gap as described above. I see no practical harm, and in fact it makes where the \"virtual hole\" goes extremely versatile.  However, it may be a fashion \"disaster\" (which I couldn't care less about, personally).",

The material is just the right thickness for a sweaty practice (like Baptiste Power Yoga)-- fairly thin, but not skimpy feeling, wicks well enough, holds some moisture, but doesn't get or feel drenched during your practice.  Verve is a small Colorado company that makes clothes for climbers.  That background shows in these pants -- the fit is just right, not tight (like a pair of long johns), but roomy (and stretchy) enough to allow easy movement between poses. Verve makes a longer Hanuman pant, that I have not tried.

It stops movement while I exercise, even running & jumping, without strapping down my chest.  It has a good shape that I even feel comfortable wearing it under my regular clothes.  I love that it hooks in the back so its easy to get in and out of.  The straps are wide enough that they rest easily on my shoulders and still provide support.  It wicks away sweat.  And they last forever! The only thing I've ever been annoyed with is the metal clasps for adjusting the straps because they fall right on my shoulder blades and sometimes dig into them when I do sit-ups on a harder surface.

However, I will add some additional information that they did not necessarily mention.\n\nThese socks are obviously well made and fairly thick.  However, they are not too thick which is a concern that I had.  They are much thicker and softer than Gold Toes Cotton Crew socks, but you must also pay for this i.e. $9.00 vs. $15.00.  On the other hand, I estimate these socks will stand up to laundering better, last much longer and will stay up with repeated washing.\n\nThe exact composition of these socks is:  84% combed cotton, 15% stretch nylon and 1% spandex.  The less expensive socks I reference above are 82% combed cotton, 17% stretch nylon and 1% spandex.  One would think this wouldn't make much difference in terms of durability, but there seems to be more weight and material overall in the higher quality socks.\n\nI have also had some experience with the WHITE COTTON CREW socks and while they are absorbent because of the high cotton content, I don't feel they held up to repeated washing well.  I also don't think they are much better than less expensively priced socks by other manufacturers.  However, the WHITE FLUFFIES are a quantum leap up and worth the extra money",

[. . .]\n\nIt's amazing that I've been a male all my life (hey, this is the 21st century), worn many a necktie, but outside of those electronic tie organizers with the lights and motors they sell in Sharper Image I have never even known what sort of way one might store their neckties except in a heap--which has been my method all the while.\n\nSo now that I'm a business-MAN, I wear these strange things every day, and I have many, so the heap has gotten quite a lot larger than it used to be.  And now I'm doomed to neatness because I'm getting hitched--so I get to wear ties more often, but 'the pants' less.\n\nAnd there in the soft center of my American male mind--the wife being Japanese--I've got this idea: Why not put my neckties on a tie rack?!  Brilliant!!  It will be a pre-emptive strike in the neatness department--major husband points.\n\nBut I don't want that dammed Sharper Image thing.  It's great as a gift but to tell the truth, it takes up more than its share of closet space and wouldn't be very becoming outside of the closet. \n\nThis thing though, very nice.  Cedar, brass, hangs on the inside of the door.  It's exactly what I was imagining, and fortunately some other brilliant man out there thought of it too.\n\nI take one point away for all the tie racks out there though, because there surely could be something just as classic and simple, but better functioning.

It was certainly WELL worth the price I paid. \n\nIf you like wearing extreme low-rise jeans or simply do not want to flash your waistband for any reason, then this brief is for you. Period. \n\nFor those men who wear standard low-rise jeans or the like, then you do not NEED this, but you still very well may WANT it. \n\nClearly this brief is meant to do two things (1) make it so that you can wear very low-rise pants and (2) make it so you look irresistable when you are NOT wearing your low-rise pants. \n\nI found that even though the underwear is cotton - as opposed to the synthetics of the X-Factor line, for example, this brief still conforms to my body's contours pretty well. Actually very well everywhere except it bunches a LITTLE where it meets the very inside of my thigh. Regardless, this is going to show off everything you got, and subsequently make it look (more-or-less) more impressive. \n\nPractical consideration: the pouch and the area above is reduced in size since it is accomodating the very low-rise. Translation: be cautious when you get aroused as there is not a great deal of \"expansion room\". Enough said on that, but that is why I gave this pair 4\/5 stars. Everything else is great. I never had a problem with my rear being exposed in these briefs. \n\nIf you forsee this as being a problem for you, then may I suggest the 2(x)ist Contrast Countour Pouch Brief 3103C?

It's youthful without being for the young.  Light-weight, low-profile, wide enough for a thick sock, and it'll get you compliments everywhere you go.\n\nMy first pair is in black, and wow, they are stylish.  Today I wore them out shopping, and my back started hurting before my feet did.  My one objection is this supposedly 'squishy' foot bed.  I don't know if my shoes were missing that part or what, but I found the sole to be hard and inflexible.  They were still _comfortable_ but it wasn't like putting your feet on pillows or anything.\n\nIf you do prefer a squishier footbed, I recommend a thin insert, so as not to squish your toes.

I have purchased this bra three times, and it was perfect when i was a 34B--provided plenty of support and i loved how it was thick enough that i never showed through my tank top when exercising, but now that i am a 34D, i don't think this bra provides enough support when i am doing high impact activities like running or kickboxing.  for low to medium activities this sports is perfect still.  but since i have taken up more rigorous activities, i have bought the panache bra (make sure to buy your EXACT size in panache)",

When my wife became pregnant, she was worried that she would have to constantly expand her wardrobe as our wonderful growing child expanded her belly (yeah, I know babies grow in uteruses, but \"belly\" just sounds so much cozier).  These Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands allowed her to wear her normal pants and skirts with the waists undone all the way up to her sixth month.\n\nAfter our child was born, my wife had no more use for the bands, but I didn't want to see them go to waste.  I have always been pretty trim, but I wondered if the Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands might work for a growing beer belly as well as a growing baby belly, so I began to eat and drink excessively, allowing my belly to grow.  My wife thought I was being idiotic, but I told her that she had had her turn, so she should let me have mine.\n\nAfter gaining fifteen pounds and a noticeable paunch, the waists of my pants no longer buttoned comfortably.  I undid my pants, wrapped my belly in one of the Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands, and threw on an old oxford shirt.  After buttoning just the top few buttons of the oxford, I looked as if I were wearing a particularly snug, extra-long, patterned t-shirt underneath.  I went to my local watering hole and none of the guys recognized that I was wearing an article of my wife's clothing!\n\nI have now become a big fan of Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands, and have bought additional bands to add to my wife's collection.  Well, I suppose I should say \"my\" collection since I'm the one wearing them.  If my wife becomes pregnant again, I will, of course, share the bands with her.  Who would have thought that my wife's pregnancy and my frugality would result in the sharing of clothing between me and my beloved?  I joke to her that my \"child\" is due any day now, and then rub my belly lovingly.  My wife gives me a strange look, sighs, and then just shakes her head.  I know she's just jealous, so I tell her, \"Hey, all you have to do is become pregnant again if you want to wear these Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands.\"  \"I don't know if your fathering another child is such a good idea,\" she replies.  I ask her what she means, but she just shakes her head and says, \"Never mind.",

These are great even to use under their regular clothes in winter. They are priced great too. When I ordered them I was not going to use them but for fall wear but now I may buy some more for the winter as well. This store is great on shipping also I ordered them regular shipping and got them in just a few days. This may depend on where you are in the USA as to how fast you get them. As far as I am concerned you cannot beat this price and versatile ways to use these cute little pants",

        "reviews":"Be forewarned! Never mind all the mellifluous flubdrub about nature-formed last, footwear classic, nineteen sixty-five, etc. The facts of the matter are that (a) the Irish factory where Wallabees were handmade with love closed down in the late 1990s; (b) the product has been made in mainland China since that time; (c) the materials and workmanship don't begin to come close to their former standards, which is duly reflected in the downward price shift ($180 in 1998 but $110 in 2006, inflation notwithstanding); yet (d) the Web sites--which claim that the shoe is \"even better\"--seem to have no problem with posting photos of the no-longer-available Irish craftsewns while shipping the Chinese hack jobs. Very, very disappointing, gentlemen.  (I once found a fellow in Ottawa who had bought up considerable quantities of sand suede Wallabees and was selling them at a premium--$225--that I was happy to pay, but even he ultimately went out of business, just like Peter, my custom Birkenstock sandalmaker in Germany.)\n\nI once phoned the vendor to complain, and some imbecile tried to explain to me that the product was \"better than ever.\" I flew into a rage, telling her what she could do with her lies. I also chastised her for having the brass-bound gall to lie to me, a diehard Wallabee fan who has continuously owned (and worn, day in and day out) several pairs--sand suede, oakwood suede, brown leather, and\/or black leather--since the age of fifteen, two-thirds of a lifetime ago! (The oakwood [= dark brown] suede were always my favorites, since the sand suede always looked a little too smart-Alecky for me, making me look [quite accurately!] like an upper-middle-class New York City Jewish boy--just mate them with Sergio Valente jeans, a creamy velour shirt, and an ultra-expensive sweater.)\n\nAll that having been vented, the Wallabee is still a reasonably comfortable shoe--assuming you can find two members of a pair that actually match within a reasonable margin of deviation! Teenage kids won't know the difference, but baby-boomers will be moved to tears. Get with the program and buy either a pair of those ultra-advanced, computer-designed, ruggedized flip-flops (there are scores of vendors) or some quality suede sneakers (leather ones are far too oppressive for the educated foot). CAVEAT EMPTOR!",

It rolls very well on the built-in wheels, and unlike it's smaller cousin the Oyster, this rolls with much more stability due to the wide stance. The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars are: 1) Sometimes the wide rolling stance is a hassle, e.g. going through narrow gates on a subway or similar, and 2) the built-in locks are not \"TSA\" locks, so in other words, they are useless for air flight.\n\nI would buy this suitcase again",

        "reviews":"My first pregnancy I tried several styles of belts, most of which had a wide band in back. I am short, have a short midriff, and am overweight, so wider belts would roll from the top down.  I never had that problem with this belt.  Unfortunately, this pregnancy I am entering my 3rd trimester and have finally out grown the 1X belt, and the store I purchased it from is now closed.  I was thrilled when I found this on Amazon.com in a larger size.  \n\nI recommend making it little snug in the mornings and then loosening it throughout the day as needed.  The most appealing feature for me is that this band is completely adjustable to give you the support you need for the different activities you will be doing throughout the day.  Any time you start needing the extra support, just slightly tighten the side straps.  When you start relaxing or if the belt starts feeling a little tight, just loosen it up a bit.  It's quick and easy to work with, and if one side needs more support than the other, just make that one side a bit more snug.  It's AWESOME!\n\nI am a technology education specialist, so I'm on my feet for, many times, 16 hrs a day training and supporting hospitals with their new computer programs.  I couldn't have survived even my First Trimester without this belt.  I raise it a little higher in the back so that I have complete lower back support and belly support.  There were days when I forgot to wear my belt that I almost couldn't walk after only 4 hrs of work due to lower back pain that would eventually extend down to my fanny and legs.  My legs would litterally give out from underneath me until I could rub and relax my lower back for a while.  When you are working with doctors in the surgery room or doing rounds with them this is NOT a good thing.  As long as I wore my belt, I NEVER had a problem.  \n\nI strongly recommend this product",

I like the convenience of having it all together. This is a great buy! Especially for college students. I was first introduced to this style ID holder in college and have been using it ever since",

When they did get wet, they dried much, much faster than cotton boxers do. \n\nThey lasted a couple of months before falling apart - a pretty good show of durability, actually, given the amount of punishment they took. I had only two pair and I alternated them, often with a full week between washings. Obviously they got kinda crusty, but that couldn't be helped. Under the circumstances they held up well. I would recommend them.\n\nAs for this boxer\/brief\/thong controversy, I believe a man should wear whatever type of underwear he finds most comfortable. If that means boxers, fine. If it means a thong, fine. What women consider stylish should be at the very bottom of a man's list of concerns.

I began wearing them in 1978, when they were sold under the French Shriner label and have not been without at least two pair ever since.  The design and production rights (thankfully) passed or were sold to Florsheim when the French Shriner marque disappeared.  \n\nThe shoes are the ULTIMATE IN COMFORT!  The uppers are of glove-soft kidskin and the soles of a firmly cushioned synthetic material.  They are suitable for everyday office wear as well as for use on formal occasions.\n\nThe factory finish is as durable as a patent leather, without the extremely high gloss plastic look.  \n\nThey are extremely durable, as some of them lasted me for more than twelve years of frequent wear.  I've never been able to wear out the one piece Comfortech sole and heel.  Ultimately, the uppers will wear through on the flex creases or at the base, where the upper is joined to the sole.  You can easily extend the wear period to ten years or more by occasional use of a good polish, especially after the shoes have been exposed to a wet environment.\n\nThey are an excellent buy at the suggested retail price of $100 to $110 that you see most often, but are an unbelievable bargain at the $90\/pair charged by Amazon.\n\nIf I had a suggestion for minor improvement for Florsheim, it would be to make the sole slightly thicker and the heel slightly wider for greater stability.\n\nI personally, would rate these shoes at six stars on a scale that had five stars for the next best shoe.  I would never go back to wearing dress shoes of conventional stiff leather and hard soles and heels.\n\nThese shoes are not perfect, but Florsheim has come VERY close with the Riva.\n\nGive them a try -- I think you will come to love them as I do!\n\nNeil Coddington\nAlbuquerque",

        "reviews":"I have short hair, not ultra-short, but short, and I find that a few hot curlers can make a big difference in volume on \"bad hair days.\" While I have a full-sized Conair curler set, I discovered that my travel set was really best suited to my hair length. So travel or not, this little set has become a real favorite. \n\nWhat you get \nThe Remington Travel Hair curlers come in a nylon bag with the heating unit build in. The top is clear and fastened by velcro. You pull it open and plug it in to start heating the rollers. On the side of the nylon bag is a smaller, oblong bag holding the roller clips. \n\nThere are five medium rollers (about an inch in diameter) and five small rollers, about 5\/8 inch diameter.) There are two sets of clips, pink for the large roller, white for the smaller roller. The clip fits around the roller, and has a tab to aid grabbing it for removal. \n\nThe rollers turn from pink to greyish white when they are heated. They fit into the base over a socket with two prongs. They heat up in about 2 minutes. \n\nHow they work \n\nThe rollers claim to have \"Ionic Technology\" to reduce static and the frizzies. I find that my hair is indeed smooth when I take it out of the rollers. After I let the curls cool, I can style with no frizz. \n\nThe ends of the rollers stay cool to avoid burning your head. They are a bit heavy. \n\nI leave the rollers in for five to fifteen minutes, by which time my hair is well-curled. \n\nUpsides, downsides \nTo keep this set compact, there are only 10 rollers. I could use a few more, even with my short hair. The built-in travel bag is very well designed and compact for a suitcase or small bathroom. \n\nIf you LOSE THE CLIPS, you can find a general replacement style of clip for about $10 at http:\/\/www.ballbeauty.com\/remington_hair_setters.htm#CLIPS. I dropped two of my white clips and the cats apparently made off with them as trophies of their hunting prowess. So this is helpful to know where to buy more clips. \n\nThe curls last long, though they aren't as stiff as with some of the more expensive, foam covered type of curlers",

I found that in hats with the Bailey Wool-Felt hat.\n\nIts comfortable and because of its material, you don't have to baby it like some hats.  If something smashes it down, it can easily be reformed back to its original shape.  The hats style alone does not say cowboy or retired yuppie, but has more practicality to it that represents an adventurer or even just an \"average joe\" with class.  Its a working mans hat to wear to town, or a city mans hat to wear while relaxing by a stream after a day of fly fishing.  \n\nMake sure to check the sizing chart if you are ordering online (I use my baseball caps, which have the sizing mark on the inside tag, as a reference) otherwise it might be best to try one on at the store and make sure it fits.  I like the way they have various sizes that encompass different exact measurements, that way no matter what, you'll find the size you are looking for.  I only say this because with baseball caps I've had trouble finding the cap I like in the pro back (non adjustable) size I need.\n\nI found the drawstring a nice addition but not something I really needed as there are never to high of winds whenever I'm wearing mine.

It's basically a very tight sports bra with snaps.  My daughter is now three months old and I find that I wear the Bravados only when my $12 Motherhood Maternity sleep bras are dirty.  I love the Motherhood bras (though I wear the sleep bra all day long).  They are much softer, easier to get on and off and the cups just pull down instead of snapping.  Even with the Bravado, I just pull the cup down instead of snapping it because it is so cumbersome to re-snap.  I won't be buying anymore Bravados.  I'll stick with the Motherhood bras or a cheap regular sports bra from now on",

I was hopeful about this bra, because it was decently priced~~and I wasn't disappointed. The underwire and 4 hooks give excellent hold, the cups are deep enough to cover everything (and keep things pointing up where they belong), and the criss-cross lacing between the cups gives it just enough of the peek-a-boo allure to make it sexy.

Actually, as a refugee from NYC (which post-9\/11 and the Bloomberg anti-Smoking Nazis is not half the brazen City it once was), I chose Utah because of the snow, the mountains, the free & easy gun laws, fewer people, and skiing. But what I don't dig is the Arctic temperatures, especially because I have an evening cigar outside every night, and it dampens the delights of cigar-smoking to have your face and eyeballs freeze. \n\nWhat to do? \n\nI took a page from the strategy-book of Chiapan Revolutionary & mask-wearing bandito SubCommandante Marcos, who wears his hairy woolly black face-shrouding balaclava wherever he goes. I dig the SubCommandante; dig his style, dig his stature, dig his designer AKs, dig his Listening Tour about the country taken on a black motorbike, a kind of 21st century homage to Che. Dig all if it, Comrade, you know? \n\nBut what I dig most of all is his ability to light & smoke his stogie through the little mouth-hole in his black balaclava. He does this all the time: there's SubCommandante, with his stogie, and he's got it sticking out of the little mouthhole, puffing away on it merrily. \n\nSo I figured: if it works for El Jefe down in Chiapas where it's 105 degrees in the shade, it probably will work wonders for me up in the mountains of Utah, where it's 5 below zero beneath the moon? Ya venceremos! \n\nSure enough, I'm digging it: I can go outside, smoke my cigar to my heart's content, and have a toasty face that doesn't freeze & splinter in the subzero frore winter blast. All well & good, even though after a few heady puffs the little mouth aperture gets a wee tad bit stinky, but oh well, that's what a washing machine was made for. Also, the ski-mask is well made, solidly sewn, and no doubt would be awesome for a cold-weather counterinsurgency. \n\nThat said, there is one big drawback: every time I wear the thing, I have an urge to carry out guerilla warfare against the bourgeois pig McMansion owner over the fence. \n\nJS",

        "reviews":"I love my PRADA bag!  Seems genuine to me, ladies and gents.  What a neat wedding shower gift this would make for the bride to take on her honeymoon!  This beach tote is adorable and well made.  Even though it's plastic, the trim is a bright red leather that looks great.  I wish they still had the FISH one in stock, I might get that, too.  \n\nThe bag is HUGE and came packaged in a GINORMOUS box. Even though the other reviews mentioned the size, I still was not prepared.  The bag is one large compartment with no \"interior\" compartments, so it's practical for a day at the beach.  I can fit a huge beach towel, sandals, a book, my INSTYLE magazine, sunblock, a water bottle, and a wristlet inside.  You'll definitely want to bring a seperate \"wristlet\" or wallet\/coin purse along with you to keep inside.  I can't wait to bring this bag on my honeymoon!  \n\nThe handbag came with an authentication card, the original ITALIAN price tag (it really WAS 500 Euros!), and a dust bag for storage.  It looks genuine with the \"PRADA\" triangle tag on one side and a leather \"PRADA label inside the bag... the labeling is subtle and not at all \"in your face\".  Perfect gift!  The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is that I would have preferred the FISH one with the orange trim, but I think it's out of stock.  Still, this is an unimaginably great price for a Prada bag.  Happy Shopping!",

Big mistake!..When I got them,even bofore I tried them on,I measured the waist. They were true to the L size. I had few M size swimwear around and I compared the waist...it was an inch larger then anything size M. So whoever sugested to get one size biger was wrong!Or maybe he had wishfull thinking about his waist size..;)\n\n        Now the good news..they stretch! So the L size still looked ok on me,because they didn't stretch at all. I have some wrinkels showing but it's nothing major.\n\n        The product itself is a high quality product. They look sexy..,but you have to have the right body for them too. Don't expect to look good if you are fat.They will make you look even fatter! They are not that low rise either,my butt crack isn't showing. The picture is actually very accurate and you can see how high they sit.\n\n     As far as \"you can see everything\"..as another reviewer mentioned, maybe he was comparing them to his boardshorts? I don't see any big difference between these trunks and any other smimwear in the same style. They are definetly not \"see through\"!\n\n     I'd love to exchange them for the size M....but the return policy allows absolutely no exchanges or returns,and that sucks! I wonder how different it is if I would go to their store and try them on in a fitting room? Also,it took one week for shipping.",

If you are looking for the 501 fit without the hassle of buttons, this may be the way to go.  The 505 is rather full in the seat and crotch (technically \"the rise\") and can look pretty baggy.  Though described as a \"slim fit\", the 512 is more of a moderate fit,  snug but not formfitting, much like the handsome 501.  Rather than slim fit, it really should be described as the 512 \"tapered leg\", because it has a pretty strong taper to the ankle, which means it will not fit over boots, unlike the 505 and the 501.

The nightgown itself has no problems - the contstruction seems sturdy, no visible flaws, and good printing, even if it is a little on the darker side.  And as she claims \"Ariel is my favorite princess\", so there was no way it wasn't going to be a hit with her.\n\nThe slippers that came with the nightgown were too small for a size 6.  They didn't even fit my three year old who wears a size 8.  I'm guessing these slippers are around a size 6.  I would have thought that they would have sized the slippers to the size of the nightgown, but now I suspect they make them \"one size fits all\" (aka \"one size too small\").  Besides being too small, there is nothing to pull up over the heel, so they constantly slip off the foot.  They were discarded after 15 minutes when my two daughters realized they looked like more fun than they actually were.\n\nThe tiarra is obviously cheaply made.  We weren't expecting any more than that.  My 4 1\/2 year old left it on the ground the first evening she got it and accidentally stepped on it breaking it cleanly in half.  Honestly, I was relieved I could get rid of it that quickly.\n\nI'm giving the product 4 stars because what we were really buying was the nightgown.

Then, a week later, they went BACK DOWN to $18 before I received the dresses. \n\nThe dresses do NOT look like the picture on the site. \nThe dress is longer than on the site. The site shows it above the knee's, the two I received, are below the knee, almost mid-calf...& I'm 5'9. \n\nIt is a \"halter\" top. On the site, I think they just rested the straps over her shoulders & did not tie behind her next.

I bought them looking for a sundress to wear out & about...this, I would probably only wear as a beach cover up or to the pool. Haven't decided. \n\nOnce I get around to getting to a post office, I plan on returning them. I keep trying them on, thinking, \"Ok, it's only $20, I should keep them.\" But I most probably would NOT have bought them if I tried them on in the store. \nThey would look cute if they were shorter, but that is more money that I would have to spend to shorten the dress. So is it really worth it??? \nHaven't decided yet. The fact I can't decided what to do w\/ them, makes me believe I need to return them. If I loved them, I would have already worn them, but I haven't. \n\nThe ONLY nice thing I can say, is the pattern & colors (both the red & the blue) are really pretty.

They provide good ankle support and keep my feet warm. Buyer beware that these boots come very very stiff, and will take time to break in.  When I first get them, I just wear them around the house occasionally until I can actually wear them out for a bit.

It features a smooth, full grain, blemishless, fully lined, leather upper, and a flexible leather sole with rubberized contact patches*. There is not much more that an Allen Edmonds, costing hundreds of dollars more, will get you.\n\nI got one in size 15M, which is my normal shoe size. Size 15M in this shoe is relatively tight-fitting at the arch, in comparison to my Florsheim 15M oxfords (two different models). So, the gentleman that remarked in earlier comments about the size being a tad smaller is correct. If I had known, I would have gotten a half-size bigger. However, that would have added unnecessary shoe length when all I needed was a quarter inch of additional coverage at the arch. I wish shoe makers had an arch fitment scale like they have with the width of the foot, i.e., medium, wide, extra wide, etc.\n\n* an earlier commenter mentioned that the rubberized outer lining on the sole started to come unglued after only a few months of wear; I cannot comment on this aspect yet as I have had these for only a few weeks yet, and have worn them only three or four time to date.

        "reviews":"I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  \n\nThe idea of \"Medium\" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32\" waist.  Is that not \"Medium\" sized? \n\nI think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  \n\nThe draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  \n\nAlso, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.\n\nI wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like \"old men's\" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.\n\nI am not a mean hearted kind of guy.

        "reviews":"I saw these shoes at Macy's yesterday for $36. They only had the red. IMO, the red is a bright, clown red. It's not a bad red, it's just a true red with no subtlety. I almost considered getting them, but I reminded myself that I was on the hunt for a black patent, pointy toe skimmer. I am *so* glad Macy's did not have the black because I got them thru Amazon for $22.\n\nI believe the shoe fits true to size. I am a 7.5M, period. In pointy shoes, I sometimes go for an 8 or avoid pointys altogether. I was going to listen to the reviews here and order an 8, but I tried on the 8 at Macy's and it was too big. I think it was a bit stretched it given that it was the floor model, but I figured even a brand new size 8 would be too big. \n\nI ordered & recvd a 7.5M. When I recvd the shoes today and put them on they were snug. Not snug in a tight or uncomfortable way. They just fit exactly to my foot. This is a leather upper and not man made. So the patent looks black and shiny! It's not cheap looking at all. The point comes to a nice triangle and isn't exagerrated. Given that they are leather, I expect them to stretch a little to my feet. \n\nThe shoes measures 10.5\" from the point to the middle of the heel. The point to the top of the shoe is 3\" and there is 1\" between my big toe and the point. There is comfortable room to move the toes and because the shoe is leather, it will form a bit to the feet as you wear them. I have experienced that already just walking around the house. The shoe looks low cut on the sides, but my foot stays completely in the shoe when I am walking. I'll be watching to see if I end up with a line\/bend across the front of the shoe. By the time that happens -- if it ever does -- I will certainly have gotten my $22 out of them. \n\nAnd finally, I am 5'2\" and I tend to avoid pointy toe shoes because it sometimes looks like I am wearing skis. These shoes are great because they elongate my leg and don't create a costume-y look. They look great peeking out of the jeans I have on and I expect them to look good w\/the new capri leggings I got the other day. \n\nHighly recommended!",

But be warned, My daughters larger text books dont fit,nor does her mead trapper looseleaf or her nike portfolio. The top corner sticks out about two to three inches and zipper is unable to fully close, so she has to carry them in her hands; which kind of defeats the purpose of carrying a handsfree bag. Spiral notebooks and mead composition books(black and white) fit perfectly. \n\n...Another gripe is she is probably 100 pounds soaking wet, so the strap isn't flush to her body. Shes a tall slim 13 1\/2 year old. It will fit the chubbies and the bustier girls a whole lot better. The velcor strip is short, so there isn't much more ability to adjust to make it tighter.\n\n...Samsonite can either make the strap shorter so it doesnt hit her booty when she walks or lenghten the amount of velcro they use so theres more ability to adjust the fit. We thought that during the colder months it might fit a little better with her winter coats, but it still hits her too low on her body. We'd rather it be a more snug fit. She still loves it though, because of the color and it holds all her stuff well...cell phone, ipod, keys, bus pass,pens etc. Minus 1\/2 a star for size and fit. Overall great bag,4 1\/2 stars",

A big one. Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it\/filling it. The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice. \n\nOf course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this \"no-show.\" I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :) \n\nFor me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded. But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief\/boxerbrief\/trunk. \n\nThis pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature. My only complaint is that the leg openings do not \"cling\" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc. But that is just minor. \n\nThe waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design. \n\nMay I suggest you go for the extra-bold 2(x)ist No Show Trunk 3133C, which comes in contrasting colors - same product, same price, just sexier! \n\nI cannot reccommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection",

While the 'Wrinkle Free\" portion isn't 100% true, they do come out of the dryer looking better than most, and after a light starch and ironing, stay quite crisp during a day's wearing. \n\nThe manufacturing quality, in my experience, is also great -- I've never had a problem with a loose seam or button.\n\nI also love that Van Heusen offers a shirt in a size 18 neck with a 32\/33 sleeve. My husband is an average-size guy with a greater-than-average neck, so finding this 18-32\/33 combo is dang near impossible in other brands. Thanks, Van Heusen",

This is the first review of this thong?\nUnbelieveable! \nI am a \"newbie\" to the thong market after growing up wearing what my Mom told me to wear; cotton briefs (tighty whiteys). \nConsider me liberated! \nAfter going through my initial \"ordering frenzy\" of thong underwear (much to my wife's \"you're developing a mid-life thong fetish\" dismay) I happened upon these.\nThey are what I would consider a \"contour or pouch\" style thong and they are, hands down, the BEST OVERALL THONG I have ever worn! They have a cotton mesh pouch (sexy, but not really \"see-through\") that is the most comfortable ride my \"boys\" have ever had. \nI absolutley love them\/live in them. \nThe Brazilian T-back makes the support across the Netherlands all but unnoticeable while the stretchy sides provide frontal support and all-around comfort. \nPlus, check out the price! \nOMG! \nAnyone who's shopped for a name brand thong knows the average going price is between 15 and 25 dollars.\nAt 8 bucks, these thongs are unbeatable, and if you don't mind the color yellow you can own one for 5. Too good! \nI bought two of every color and am hoping they still make these when those wear out. \nIt will be a sad day in the Underworld when these thongs become unavailable.\nAttention atheltes; added bonus! These are comfortable enough to wear while running, jogging or working-out. \nThe cotton pouch is softer than any jock I've ever encountered (while offering equal support) and the lack of those \"butt straps\" adds an easy 2-3 mph to my runs. \nSeriously (I'm sure it's physcological)! \nTHESE THONGS ROCK. \nPlus, she thinks they are way sexy (bonus-bonus, nudge-nudge) as the pouch was designed and sewn by someone who knows something about the male anatomy and physiology (evoking \"Yeah, Baby, Yeah\" from the Mrs). \nDon't miss out on these - you'll be sorry",

In fact there were no tags on it at all to \n      inform me of where it was made, what it was made of, washing instructions, etc.  it did not even have the \n      name of the manufacturer!!!!\n\n3.  The plastic band felt very fragile like it would break with the slightest pressure.  Adjusting the width was \n      nerve-racking because I had to be very careful not to break it!\n\n4.  The \"wool\"(?) had a very SYNTHETIC feel to it.  Furthermore it was sparse and flat.... NOT warm and fuzzy.  I  \n      doubt very much it is sheepskin as claimed by GemAvenue.

My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow",

While everyone else is standing at the door, pulling their umbrellas shut, you just pop it down and go inside. I never had a problem with the open\/close mechanism. The colors that this umbrella comes in are also so cheerful - mine was the bright green color.\n\nThe small size of this umbrella makes it easy to tuck into your purse (or man-bag) if you're not sure about the weather. It is a little heavy for such a small size, but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nIf the rib of this umbrella hadn't broken so suddenly, I would have given this product 5 stars.

Yet, all the robes in department stores were light and not nearly warm enough.\n\nI found this robe after a long search and have been very pleased.  It keeps me very warm and is easy to throw on and off.  It's made of absorbent material so that I don't feel cold water spots on my back after getting out of the shower.  It's the heaviest robe I could find.\n\nI can't say there are any complaints.  It is a little big for me (one size fits all) and the sleeves do get in the way and knock things over on my bathroom counter, but warmth is what I was after, and this fills that bill.",

Though this has been somewhat jokingly christened 'the bedtime slipper,' for looseness off the foot, the line on working feet is very visible, especially after repeated use.  Where Bloch and Capezio tend to require multiple fittings and testing of different styles- especially through mail order- Sansha styles, as long as they are purchased in the correct approximate widths and lengths, will mold to individual feet and stand for years with good care.  \n\nThe only reservation I have about these shoes is the leather soles' capacity for holding onto everything they pass over for an extended period of time.  If you dance in a meticulous studio, this is not an issue, but where a stray drop of soda or Gatorade is occassionally spilt, you may want to scuff the soles once a week.  Washing does not seem to clean the leather as well as the canvas, and eventual buildup will impede turns",

As a buxom woman (36DDD), I'm cursed with \"wandering\" nipples, bra lines showing through shirts and sweaters, bossoms that \"swing low\" and other embarrassing problems. This bra is relatively comfortable generally speaking, and it is VERY comfortable compared to minimizers and other \"hold'em up and hold'em in place\" bras. Personally, I think the svelt look of the bra is gorgeous.  With a big chest, I've never been able to wear those lacy little bras from Victoria's Secret, so this is actually a big improvement over what my husband refers to as \"industrial strength\" bras like our grandmothers wear. I only give it four stars because the underwire is not comfortable if you sit for long periods of time at a desk like I do; it begins to \"dig in\" a bit right beneath the rib cage.  Overall, it's a great bra to (1) hide nipples, (2) provide your breasts with a wonderfully rounded shape, (3) hides bra lines (great t-shirt bra), and (4) show off your cleavage but not the bra itself (if you wear a low cut blouse).

The front zipper compartment was perfect for the quart size zip lock bag you are now required to have for airport security, plus it held my book and snacks for easy access.

I love these sandals.  Pros....mold to your feet, slip ons, can be dressy or casual.  Cons....even though they are advertised as having anti smell soles, they stink.  After wearing them for about a month, the soles smell awful.  My family call these sandals, \"your stinky sandals\".  They complain when I take them off because they reeeek of sweaty,smelly feet.  Remedy:  Refresh RX foot power...this stuff will get rid of any smelly foot odor in any shoe.  I hope Columbia never stops making this slider, I just wish they didn't smell of sweaty feet so fast.",

It turns out that the wallet I just received lacks a secured compartment for storing dollar bills. This is because one end of this comparment is entirely open and the compartment for the dollar bills is secured only when the entire wallet is folded.  I fail to appreciate how this product can even be called a wallet when there is no secured compartment for bills. Granted, commados may never need to carry dollar bills or they are trained with special skills to secure them in this product.

The shipping and billing was very speedy and with little delay I had the jersey delivered to my doorstep. It went downhill from there.\n\nAs soon as I opened the package I noticed that the 'GSH' (George S. Halas) initials had been sewn over and was broken. Very disappointing. I called FansEdge and they were great on the phone and sent me another jersey. While waiting for the replacement jersey I wore the defective one. By the time the replacement jersey came the iron-on stripes on the sleeves started to peel off. I figured it was just a defective jersey and opened the replacement one. It was exactly the same way. So either FansEdge received a batch of jerseys that were of poor quality or Reebok is maximizing their profit margins and overpricing a cheaply made jersey with one of the most incredible athletes ever name on it.\n\nAfter asking and waiting 2 weeks for FansEdge to check their supply of jerseys to see if they were all like this with no reply...I cancelled my order. I am still waiting for a refund. This has been over a month now.\n\nWith the poor support of FansEdge and what appears like a poorly made jersey I cannot recommend anyone getting this. If you absolutely want one I recommend buying from a brick and mortar store.\n\n1\/",

I call the next day around two to hear from the supervisor that even though THEY put the 15th, it was an error and shouldn't have been there, and he wouldn't refund me the 5 bucks.

I'm so angry.\n\nAside from being deceived, I was treated so poorly. How do people act like this? When I initially called, I had no idea it would turn into this, otherwise I would've had \"gathered evidence.\" as my friends tell me.

It is definitely big enough for the average man's toiletries.\n\nI like it. It also doesn't have a lot of inside pockets. There is just one wallet-sized pouch inside which doesn't have its own zipper. Not a mesh. I'm not sure what it's big enough for - floss and lip balm? The rest of the inside is open and free. It has a water-proof lining and a wire with flaps to open the compartment wide (essential in a toiletries bag really). Well-crafted from what I can tell.\n\nThe outside is a very handsome patterned leather. It looks aged without looking worn. It also smells of leather out of the box - so much nicer than the faux-leather travel kits. You won't mind having your clothes rub against it in your luggage.\n\nI have a slight quibble with the handle - it is not as easy to grab as in most kits.

I've had a number of them for years, and they still hold up. I also think they are really comfortable. Also, someone said they are knock off of women's underwear. Jockey made men's Elance bikinis long before they made ANY underwear for women. However, online you can generally only get them in black, grey, and white, which are ok, but not the most fun. You can get a wider variety of colors at department stores. Walmart sells them in a huge variety of colors as the Life brand. \n\nBut a lot better than these are the Hanro Cotton Stretch brief, also for sale on Amazon.

The product is not leather, its nylon, and it sort of looks cheap? The inside material is sued, but that's only the lining for the base of the wallet. Also, The wallet part is very hard to use. You cant really put too much in the wallet- The credit card slots are a little too snug, and there is no place for my I.D. The wallet included a small \"note book\" but it also doesn't fit in the wallet? I was very excited about this product, but now I feel duped. The pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality, and that it was user friendly, but it's not. I do not recommend this product",

The low profile sole is not cushy at all and is perfectly supportive yet nicely flexible with a very smooth heel-to-toe transition.

        "reviews":"I have 43 years of hiking, backpacking and peak bagging experience. In recent years I migrated, like most people, from all-leather European-style mountain boots to lighter fabric\/leather combination boots. They seemed to work well for a while but two years ago I started experiencing significant pain in my toes, instep and heel. I concluded that my lightweight boots from a well known outdoor supplier were a contributing factor, if not the root of the problem because they didn't provide sufficient torsional (side-to-side) rigidity.\n\nDanner's advertisement for the \"Terra Force\" boot support system convinced me to buy the Radical GTX two years ago.\n\nThe first thing I liked about the Radicals was the roomy box toe area that eliminated occasional rubbing problems caused by my prior boots' smaller toe box. There was also plenty of instep space for my high arch. Unlike many boots that now come in a single width the Radical's multiple widths allow a wider fit in the ball of the foot while retaining the snug heel fit that prevents blisters.\n\nThe Terra Force torsional support has not diminished after 250+ miles of hiking. Besides day hikes and 2-3 day backpacks I've used the Radicals with good results on off-trail scrambles to summits in the High Sierra and North Cascades, occasionally crossing snow steep enough to require an ice axe. Despite offering much more support than my prior lightweight boots the Radicals are hardly heavier (my size 10.5-EE's weigh 52 ounces). Best of all, after switching to the Radicals my toe and instep problems ceased almost immediately, and my heel problems have gradually diminished substantially, all of which I attribute to the superior support of the Terra Force system.\n\nIn my opinion these boots have too many seams and different pieces of leather and fabric, but I'm not marking down my rating because that's how virtually all lightweight, relatively inexpensive boots are made these days",

I ended up buying the 7, even though it was a little small, but I read about a great trick to help mold the shoes to my feet, that works like a charm: throw them in the clothes dyer for two minutes on medium heat, then pull them out, and while they are toasty warm, immediately put them on your feet and wear them for about a half hour, and voila, they will now fit perfectly!\n\nGrade: A-",

I was trying to replace a pair I had accidentally washed in the washing machine (a no-no with this fabric). Turns out the replacements were twice the quality of what I had originally purchased. I will probably be purchasing more. \nYour wife will thank you for buying these. Excellent quality, and softer than satin. My only complaint is that the fly tends to fall open sometimes, because it's made without a fastener. The idea is for a sleeker feel, but it sacrifices security. Love 'em anyway",

A big one. Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it\/filling it. The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice.\n\nOf course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this \"no-show.\" I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :)\n\nFor me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded. But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief\/boxerbrief\/trunk.\n\nThis pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature. My only complaint is that the leg openings do not \"cling\" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc. But that is just minor.\n\nThe waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design.\n\nMay I suggest you go for the extra-bold 2(x)ist No Show Trunk 3133C, which comes in contrasting colors - same product, same price, just sexier!\n\nI cannot reccommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection",

The pouch is second to none. Roomy, comfortable, and keeps you in place. The strap is hardly noticeable at all, unless you want it to be.

Make shorter, non-maternity shirts appear longer so you can wear them for longer\n2. Allow you to wear non-maternity pants with the button undone - even jeans!\n3. Hold the bands of maternity pants up so you can wear those earlier.\n4. Keep everything tucked in a supported so you feel more confident and less flabby.\nSo far, I'm wearing them tucked over once, but I'm sure later in my pregnancy I will expand them to full size and they'll be an added comfort and peace of mind.

Red\/white sweatshirt = red\/white head-band, orange\/white hoodie, orange\/white head-band, etc. etc. etc.  At first it was out of practicality... exercising, etc. but with the head-band, well, the story behind that is that I was too cheap to buy a new set of head-phones for djing, and the speaker of the left side broke off, leaving it lose.  Great for djing, but the remnant of the plastic was rather uncomfortable right behind your ear.  So... I had a headband on one day and I got to keep using my old rag-tag headphones that I loved so much (I've since stopped being so cheap and got a new set).

A take a few steps and think, 'these are quite comfy.' I smile, another great purchase. I look down. I blink. I look down again to my amazement. The white leather uppers have started to change colors! A darker red at the seams and a lighter pink on the surface of the leather. I continue my walk. A pink storm begins to overwhelm my white beauties! Now, I'm not worried about it, you know, I can handle pink, but deep down inside, I really wanted them to be white. I finish my walk, my macho-ness slightly tainted, re-enter my home, take of my pink three-striped wonders, and set them down to think. They changed back! They are white again.

It is indeed very roomy and I would classify it as a daybag or travelbag because it isn't as limited as most \"lunchbags\", but still great for days at the office. For those of you that are troubled by coworkers \"borrowing\" your food and drinks from the company refrigerator, your troubles will be over with this bag. Tons of room to include cooling packs to keep at least a long day's worth of food and drinks chilly. The top of the bag has a seperate section that will hold all your other daily needs, whether it be reading material, including full size magazines you won't have to roll up or to fit in, medications, keys, cell phone, PDAs and what have you. The other compartments will accomodate you further. Conveniently, there are compartments where you can keep things hidden, so that personal items or valuables don't have to be displayed at any time, unless you choose to do so. This bag appears to be really well made, nothing cheap about it or ill planned. The zipper pulls alone tell the story, large, heavy and solid, accomodating for the smaller hand all the way up to very large men's hands. The stitching appears to be very well done and not prone to come apart easily. The dual handles at the top will allow for carrying with one hand, or clip on the adjustable strap for a more hands free tote. The thickness of the insulation is more than adequate, much thicker than most of the off the shelf type insualted bags, it is what you would expect in a premium bag. The fabric is quality denier that looks like it will be able to hold up to heavy use and easy to wipe clean, like most denier. I would not be surprised to see a flight crew carrying this insulated tote, as it has the style of simple elegance that you usually see with their carryons, suitable for even a daybag phobic male, but sleek enough for a woman to feel as though she hasn't just joined a brown bagger construction crew. This bag doesn't look out of place in the office or at a worksite, the beauty of classic neutral design for the causual person or professional. It has enough capacity to work for a picnic bag for several people. My mother was eyeing it for use to carry all her copious amounts of makeup on her trip to Vegas, with keeping all of it cool in mind. That plot didn't succeed, it has not yet seen Vegas, but nice try mom, lol. The sticker shock for this bag may seem high if you are used to throw away bags from mass retailers, but this is a worthwhile investment for those needing quality and more space. Overall value very high and more than worth the money. Hey, just what the coworkers swipe in a month's time might pay for the whole bag by itself.",

        "reviews":"My search for the perfect gym bag is like my search for the perfect hair drying, yoga mat, organizing products, garlic press (Zyliss) etc. Fortunately, my search for the perfect gym bag is officially over. The Ogio Locker Bag is brilliant and the inventor should get some sort of award. K.R.T. Seeley's review sums it up pretty well, but here are a few things to add. For one thing, the shoe area also nicely accommodates a hair dryer or curling iron. One of the reasons this matters is that it points up a critical advantage of the shelf separating the shoe area from the upper part of the bag: while the shelf is sturdy, it's also adjustable. It goes only low enough to allow for a pair of shoes, but it can also be raised to allow for other items. \n\nNext, while it's very nice that the front end panel has all these handy little pockets for things like shampoo, brush, and whatnot, actually including containers that fit the pockets shows a real consideration for their users. Another plus is the number of outside pockets, several of which are not only zippered but waterproof as well, for, say, wet bathing suits. \n\nBefore I bought this bag, I called my gym and yes, I really did make them go measure the width of their lockers. The magic number was 12\". At 8\", the Ogio bag fits in with room to spare. \n\nFor raqueteers (sports, not crime), there are several loops on one of the end panels for holding racquets and a couple of others I haven't quite figured out yet. \n\nFor yogis and yoginis, yes, the adjustable strap on the end panel can accommodate a yoga mat, if it's not too thick. \n\nAn outer side pocket nicely accomodates my workout journal (yes, I'm a fanatical record keeper), as well as my beloved NewGrips (just do a search on NewGrip) which are indispensable for rowing (notoriously hard on the hands) and weight-lifting (and about a billion other things for those of us with carpal tunnel, arthritis, or, in my case, both). Another outside pocket is perfect for a CD player and headphones. \n\nThe only improvement I can imagine for this bag would be adjustable straps on the bottom to hold larger, rolled towels or mats. Unfortunately, even Title9 doesn't seem to carry that one anymore. \n\nIn other words, this bag is the best on the market. It's a bit pricey but it's worth absolutely every cent. I suspect that quite a lot of my friends will be getting the Ogio for Christmas and birthdays and whatnot. Congrats, Ogio, and thank you very, very much",

It makes him more comfortable when he wears them outside to get the mail, the paper, etc. because he doesn't have to worry about the side of the slipper getting wet by dew on the grass or the small puddles left by the sprinklers.\n\nThey appear to be very well made and durable, he hasn't had them long enough to know if they really are but they seem to be.  We live in Florida so it is difficult to find slippers that can be worn year round and the flannel lining in these keeps your feet warm in cool weather and not too hot in warm weather.  \n\nOne thing about these though is we had to return the first pair because they were a little snug on his feet.  According to him, because of the rubber sole wrapping up along the side prevented them from giving so they were a little tight.  We had to go a size larger than he usually wears.  When he got the larger pair, he was and continues to be a happy camper",

This was obviously a manufacturing defect seein it was the same color as the logo which was also smudged. Also, the shoe glue was leaking out the back of the shoe.

        "reviews":"This is truly a beautiful bag!  I got the classic dark leather, which is exactly the rich brown shown in the pictures.  The leather has a wonderful grain that adds to the bag's character.  The leather is thicker than I expected; while it is by no means stiff, it is not ultra-soft, ultra-thin butter leather.  This is leather that will age well and last for many, many years.  The zippers are matte silver metal so not only do they look great against the brown leather, they'll be durable.  (The other hardware is the same type of matte\/antiqued silver.)  The bag is lined with a heavy khaki twill that is just a shade or two lighter than the strap.  The cotton strap not only adds to the bag's uniqueness, it also keeps the bag from sliding when you bend over. (I wear it across my chest like a messenger bag.) Inside there are two small pockets on the divider separating the two sections of the bag.  One is gusseted and works well for a cell phone (or items of a similar size) and the other is suitable only for small flat items such as business cards; I would have really liked for my iPod to snuggle in that second pocket but something that thick won't fit.  The internal sections of the bag are large enough to hold a notebook, file or book but the bag is smaller than most of the other messenger bags I've tried because they were sized for laptops. I actually use it as a purse and it has plenty of room for all of my junk and the ubiquitous book. On the outside, each end of the bag has a pocket that has a vertical row of stitching bisecting it.  This creates 2 tall, thin pockets where I keep pens; it would have been nice if one side didn't have that row of stitching so that it could hold larger items, but that's not a problem for me.  The entire back side of the bag is another zippered pocket.  On the front flap is a small zippered pocket that turns out to be a good home for a cell phone because you can get to it quickly without going into the bag.  The magnetic closure on the flap is sufficiently strong.  There are 2 magnets in the body of the bag and in the flap there is a metal bar running the width of the flap so you don't have to worry about lining up magnets to close the bag.  I've had the bag only a few days and have already received compliments.  Though the bag is pricey, it is obviously crafted with care from high-quality materials.  It also has a very distinctive look.  I am very happy with this purchase and have already added another Diongini bag to my Amazon Wish List",

I was a little hesitant at first but for the price I decided to order 2, I hate returning things and if it's right I take 2!  When they came I was happy, they were exactly what I wanted with an extra velcroed pocket inside.  If you never tried a nylon wallet but have wanted to, you ought to give this one a try.  If you are the type of guy who likes to show off 10 pictures of his children, car, wife or girlfriends this isn't for you, it doesn't come with a multi-plastic picture folder.  If you want a secure rugged container for all your wallet valuables, here's one for you! There's even a velco strip to keep your wallet closed shut, a nice added feature that will allow you to take your wallet out in total darkness without being afraid you might loose something from inside, even if you drop your wallet.

        "reviews":"The purse size was true to the dimensions listed, but the lining not the quality I expected.  The explanation for the \"water-resistant\" nylon as opposed to silk lining was that it made it more practical as a backpack, however, this bag is obviously not designed to be a backpack.  The leather is high quality and you wouldn't want to be exposing it to the elements for any significant length of time, much less trying to put anything larger than a paperback in the interior.\n I really like the versitality of the various pockets and pouches, including the interior wallet, and the magnetic snaps hold everything together pretty well.  It is remarkably light, even with all my stuff in it. The color and appearance shown here are true to the actual product. I like the fact that the wallet is at the top of the zippered partition, so you have easy access to your cards, cash, etc, without having to dig around.  All the pockets have zippers and snaps for extra security.\nWe'll see how it holds up over time!",

        "reviews":"Shoes.com provided wonderfully fast service and a decent sandal price.  Too bad my feet are so impossible; my fault, not theirs!  A friend with a larger size and  medium width tells me she has worn hers \"Margie\" sandal comfortably for 12 years.  They still look new, as evidenced by my ordering them after seeing how lovely they were when she wore them to a recent event.\n\nBass always produces a good product.  I ordered the \"tan distressed\" and they are beautiful sandals, with sumptuously comfy soles.  They are adequately sturdy, while also enabling feet to still look dainty and shapely.  For the $30 which I paid, free postage, they are a fairly good buy.  \n\nNevertheless, these sandals are not perfectly comfortable for me, perhaps more my fault than theirs.  My advice to a person with small, narrow feet is that this product may not be exactly right.  The front straps are in a fixed position, as are most strappy sandals, while the back ones are adjustable.  This said, the size 7 Narrow is not for a truly narrow foot, mainly due to the positioning and size of the front straps.  \n\nI will keep these sandals and can wear them \"around,\" but on day trips or shopping I would probably not be able to endure the slight floppiness.  There is just a tad too much give for my  foot.  Even the back strap isn't quite perfect for me, as it tends to force the foot forward when adjusted in the tightest position.  Yet I need the very tightest buckle hole in order to keep the shoe on my foot at all.  \n\nWould I have bought these had I been shopping in a store, where I could have tried them on?  Probably not.  But I've been to dozens of quality shoe stores already this summer, to no avail seeking my size in this type sandal. At one point, I went store-to-store at a huge outlet mall, hitting every place with shoes, including Bass itself.  At one store, Etienne Aigner, I was so frustrated that I made the comment that they no longer carried either my size or my style.  When the saleswoman heard I wore a narrow, she said, \"Oh we'll, never go back to THOSE again.\"  It seems as if most stores consider customers with dainty, narrow feet an oddity, not deserving to find shoes at all.   So perhaps, in spite of my dissatisfaction with the sandals in question, I did well by ordering them.",

I've realized that the wicking keeps the dampness from creating that gym sock smell. Fresh sweat, gross as it sounds, doesn't have that sickening odor.

I do appreciate the covered toe which I feel is a very big bonus for this shoe - it's not obtrusive and doesn't ruin the look of the shoe at all, but definitely helps during the aforementioned pushing off during inclines in that the front of the shoe stays relatively undamaged.  The ankle support is good and hits right at the ankle bone so flexibility isn't impeded.  I live in a wet climate and have never had any issues with leaking, so the waterproof claim is reliable.

The number of credit card slots is kept to a minimum (3) which is perfect for a check card, a business credit card and a personal credit card. \n\nI like to pay cash, flash my ID when I go to a bar, and actually use the change I get instead of collecting it in a big jar. I used to have a smaller wallet and was afraid that this would not fit in my front pocket. It turns out that this is actually a bit slimmer and its larger dimension is still short enough to comfortably fit in a low-rise jeans front pocket. \n\nThe wallet is really handmade in Italy and looks and smells great. Even comes with the warranty directly from the Italian artisans. \n\nThis is definitely not for those who carry and regularly use lots of credit cards",

After wearing through several insoles and a number of laces, the stitching on the heel finally started to give out. For the next several years, I tried boots from a number of other manufacturers, but none have lasted more than a single year, and none were quite as comfortable for extended wear.\n\nI switched back to the Sundowner Classic this fall. While production of these boots has moved from Italy to China since my last pair, the build quality seems equivalent. The only minor difference is that the leather seems to scuff\/scratch a bit easier; hopefully this will not impact their long-term performance. Highly recommended",

        "reviews":"Theoretically speaking, this seems to be a handy little doo-dad\/gizmo\/thingamabob for the well-organized\/obsessive-compulsive traveler, but please take note of the following pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n1. It gives you a fairly accurate preview of the weight of your luggage (+\/- a few ounces) saving you the irritation of arriving at the airline counter with over-heavy luggage, and having to repack and shuffle potentially embarrassing items around in full view of the other passengers.\n\n2. You can use the tape measure to verify that your carry-on luggage will fit in the overhead compartment, or under the seat.  This saves you from participating in the dreaded and ruthless shoving tournament of the skies, where people try to stuff bags the size of newborn elephants into the overhead lockers.\n\nCons:\n\n1. It has the capacity to weigh suitcases up to 75 lbs, but when you're traveling alone, it's very awkward to lift a suitcase even half that weight with your arms extended (so that it doesn't touch your body) and still read the tiny numbers on the dial. \n\n2. The handle is small and \"ergonometrically-challenged\", and people who can't lift a 50 lb suitcase with one outstretched hand will find it very difficult to get two hands in there.  Even if you do manage to get this far, you won't be able to hold it for long before the handle sinks deep into your palm, cutting you a new lifeline.\n\n3. You need to try to balance the suitcase by centering the hook on the suitcase handle, but if you lift too quickly, the hook slips to one side, causing possible grievous bodily harm as the suitcase comes down on your toe.\n\n4. Another hook problem - you can see that the hook is an open design. If you are lifting the suitcase, the hook can slip off on the way up, causing the suitcase to fall as in 3. above. Even worse, the momentum keeps your hand moving upwards, and not only can you give yourself a shiner or broken nose with the back of your hand, but the hook can swing up and jab you in the eye. (True story)\n\n\nYou can use it on lighter luggage without too many problems, but then again, if your luggage is light you have no need to fear the scale - do you?  On the surface this sounds like a great travel gadget, but beware of the pitfalls.\n\n\nAmanda Richards, September 22, 200",

After wearing the M1122 shoe for only a few months, my pair started producing a very strong odor. The smell was not from the inside but from the outer backside, specifically the area consisting of the ENCAP material which, according to New Balance, is a polyurethane plastic. The smell gradually got worse, so bad in fact, I had to keep them in my garage with the smell being like a mildew\/urine odor. I don't own pets, nor had I gotten anything sprayed on it. The smell didn't suddenly occur either, it gradually became more intense over a few weeks. Washing the shoes in the washer wouldn't get the smell out so I returned them to a New Balance store in late December 2006, and they replaced it with a new pair. Up until this past week (late March 2007), the new pair has been great, but now they have started putting off the very same odor, again, not inside the shoe, but coming from the areas on the shoe that the ENCAP material is featured. I decided to call New Balance directly and informed them of the problem. They told me that they did in fact have other complaints from people all commenting of an odd odor coming from the M1122 model shoe. NB requested the pair be sent to them for testing. If you have experienced this problem with your M1122 (or other models), contact New Balance customer support via their website. \n\n** With regards to comfort I give this shoe a five star, but with regards to the problem above, I would have to give it a zero star.

The 991's were the Cadillac of running shoes, your could wear them ALL day and suffer very little fatigue. The 992's have a stiffer sole and the overall quality of the shoe seems like it will last longer. The 991 had some cheaper plastic parts that liked to crack and fall off. \n\n991 pros; comfortable, the better running shoe, cheaper\n\n992 pros; not quite as comfortable but still better than most, will last longer, looks more stylish\n\nFor those of you trying to choose between these and another brand, remember that these shoes are made in the USA and not by sweat shop workers in another country. They both hold up very well over the long run compared to other brands.",

Microride outsole consists of smaller sized absorption grooves (aka Nike Shox lookalike). Gigarides and Megarides emphasize shock absorption. Microride is more concerned with weight, it seems like.\n\nThere are also two models of Microride, one with full fabric top, another with synthetic leather construction. This one is the full fabric, which is supposed to be soft, and also lighter. (The synthetic leather is supposed to be more durable.)\n\nAnyway, with the combination of Microride and full mesh top, this shoe is low and very light. I can't find a number anywhere, but once started running, the shoes feel like featherweight. The impact is a little bit harder, due to less shock absorption, so it's probably more of a treadmill shoe than trails. Overall, though, very comfortable. It's my first time with running shoes this light and I like it. With these, I achieved my fastest pace ever with less effort than I would have expected.\n\nA couple of things I did notice: the size is on the narrow\/small side (compared to my Nikes), and the back heel support is a bit hard\/tall for my liking. The white version gets dirty quickly. Running was good, but walking on wet road experienced slight slippage. Also, the workmanship leaves a bit to be desired",

Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  \n\nThe idea of \"Medium\" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32\" waist.  Is that not \"Medium\" sized? \n\nI think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  \n\nThe draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  \n\nAlso, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.\n\nI wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like \"old men's\" underwear.

Firstly, the insole provided doesn't seem to fit the inside of the shoe properly. Almost like it's too wide. My foot is neither narrow nor wide, so this isn't something I typically notice about a shoe. There is an arch, but because of the weirdly shaped insole it doesn't provide any support. The zig zap strap is a really cute feature that I love, but it just adds to the uncomfort of the shoe. You can tighten the strap to keep your foot from sliding around inside, but then it cuts off circulation and leaves painful imprints. If you leave it too loose then you leave your feet pretty unstable. \n\nAll in all, a versatile mary jane with good looks but no comfort",

I will wear this now and indefinitely after the baby comes: it's apparent that it will fit me well after baby too.\nThe quality of the fabric is substantial enough to hold large (and engorging) breasts without the need for a bra.  It is strong but breathable, and not flimsy so it slightly smoothes out quirks of the pregnant body.\nThe length is a little longer than most - it slightly covers my knees -  which is what I wanted so slit is nice to have for normal strides walking, easing out of bed, hiking up to use the washroom, etc. without tearing the seams. \nAs the description and the other review indicates, the cups can slide down for pumping or nursing.\nI'm very happy with the colors, design, and construction of all items.

I looked around for a while before going with this package deal and I'm happy I took the time to do so. \n\nThe case is snug enough so your Zen won't move around in it but it doesn't button mash either. The download\/charging port on the bottom is large enough to allow the adapter to plug in easily - so once the case goes on you never really have to take it off. The power switch, headphone jack, and microphone all have openings that are completely functional. The belt clip, kick stand and arm band are all bonus add-ons that can be used or not depending on your needs. And finally the flip screen helps protect your valuable screen which is the main reason I bought this. \n\nThe film screen protector is difficult to put on without leaving any air bubbles underneath so I took mine off in the end.

I mean, at almost $25 invested included shipping, I was expecting better quality. \n\nWell, it's very thin, made in China, and has plastic snaps. The so-called polyester lining just adds to the heat that's generated. I've owned many ponchos through the years, and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period. The reason involves the way it's cut. What I've learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn't lift it up or out and allow the elements inside.\n\nNext, you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time. So, a good lining, or a breathable system is required.\n\nIf you're just going to use it for short bursts in the rain, then you can get a cheap $10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere. However, if you camp a lot, or will be out in the elements, you need better. The best poncho I ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner. This solves both of the problems I mentioned, because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat",

I am female, and while wallets are traditionally a male style, I wanted something that wasn't just a coin purse or a typical woman's purse - you know, with the clasp pouch for coins and dividers etc, b\/c I find those very cumbersome. This is compact, light, it has plenty of pockets, slots and dividers inside - that zip again comes in handy if you fill up all the spaces inside it ensures you won't lose anything.\nI gave it four stars instead of five just b\/c the coin pocket (while strategically placed and pleasingly compact) is a little hard to get your fingers in to put coins in and take them out quickly, it's kind of tight. Also, the center divider (for your pictures or drivers license etc.) sometimes gets in the way when you want to zip the wallet up - like if you are in a hurry to get out of the line at Starbucks and you are struggling to shove your change in the little slot and zip it up!\nBut this really is a great purse\/wallet.

If you are comfortable with power tools you can also drill new holes as needed. Place the belt (finished side down) on a chunk of scrap wood, drill from the back (unfinished inside) side of the belt for best results.

        "reviews":"I ditched the bulky jewel cases for my cds a long time ago in favor of nice binders that would hold the disk and the artwork securely without taking up too much space.  Since my collection continues to grow much faster than I anticipated, I recently started looking to buy more binders.  Alas, the ones I already had (No Boundaries, from Wal-Mart of all places) don't seem to be available anymore, so a pretty exhaustive search of online options brought me to this item.  \n\nBasically, this binder has pretty much everything I was looking for:  three ring construction, a sturdy zipper closure to keep discs safe and contained, and a sewn-in handle at the back so it's portable.  A plus about this particular model is that the rings are slightly oversized for the stated capacity, so there is the possibiity of expanding by buying more sheets.  I bought three, and they work great.  I will buy more - several more, because they are the best option there is at present.  \n\nLet me tell you, however, what I don't like about them.  First, the cover is some sort of plastic or vinyl.  I can see this cracking or disintigrating in a couple of years, even with gentle treatment.  Second, there isn't a proper spine to the binder:  it's basically a single, flexible sheet that wraps around the outside but doesn't make square corners.  That means it will look  untidy on the shelf and also makes me question its long-term durability.  Third, the sleeves:  they are too tight to put the disc and the artwork in the same slot, the ones closest to the rings have their corners notched in to accomodate the rings, and the slits are oriented to the zipper side instead of to the top.   \n\nThose drawbacks aside, I plan to buy more of these.  They are the best choice available now, but I wouldn't hesitate to ditch them if something better became available.  If you are looking for a safe, flexible, and smart place to store a lot of cds, this item should be at the top of your list.",

I think I'll get one of each support level and then I'll get one more of each.  It even has adjustable hooks in the elastic band around the chest, so as you lose those Lbs while wearing this great top, you'll be able to adjust it to fit you as you slim down.  I'll never have to search high and low again.  I'll know exactly where to turn whenever I need a sports bra that will support my \"needs\".  Thank you Figleaves, you really have a great product.

The \"iSkin eVo3 Athletic Protective Case\" has a hard plastic see through cover that fits over the entire front of the iPod.  The silicon cover is soft (and sticky so it prevents sliding - especially if you remove the clip) and is easy to put on.  The case covers the whole ipod except the headphone jack and has a \"flap\" that fits over (and into) the connection on the bottom.  You use the click wheel and the slide on top through the silicon.\n\nIt also looks pretty good.\n\nThe only thing that takes some getting used to is the silicon over the click wheel.  It, like the click wheel was when I first got the iPod, takes some getting used to.  It's pretty thin and tends to buckle if you push hard.  (Don't worry, though.  It fixes itself when you pick up your finger.)\n\nIf you're looking for a good quality, semi cool looking, funcional cover, this is a pretty good choice.\n\nEither way, enjoy and share your music whenever you can!!",

The directions tell you go gently pull the springs apart and slide them from your hair.  Well, we pulled the springs apart but to get the beads out of her hair we needed to destroy the bead because the hair was tangled in the springs.  None of the beads could be reused and my daughter is afraid to use the product again because it pulled her hair when we removed the beads.

No corners to negotiate, and no top cover to flip up and hold out of the way while you butterfinger your camera in and out of the case.  Pretty weatherproof and shockproof, too.  It provides great protection for your camera.\n\nI got a little carried away and kept the USB cable for my camera in the accessory pocket along with two extra batteries and a media card.  And this actually worked for several months (!) before I broke the zipper.  I could have bought a differently designed replacement case locally--there are dozens and dozens of them--but none were anything like as suited to my needs and tastes as this little CaseLogic.  So I ordered another one from Amazon exactly like the one I ruined.\n\nIf there's anything I'd change about the case, it would be to add a small hand strap.  But that's not been an issue for me.  If I want to carry it in my hand, I just slip a finger through the belt look and carry it that way.\n\nI've learned my lesson about storing the USB cable in the accessory pocket.

It is a bit smaller than my current purse, but in summer I carry less, just my wallet, cellphone, small address book, pen and a small paperback book.  The leather smells so good.  The strap is ample and the handle is convenient for carrying the backpack.  I wish the zippered compartment's lining was a light color, but at least it opens up to give you exposure to locate items that sometimes fall to the bottom of the purse. The hidden compartment mentioned in the description is very small and doesn't have much room for a lot of items.  The quality of the item is very good and worth the price, although the $18.40 for shipping was a bit more than I wanted to pay.  All in all a good deal",

They are holding up very well in the wash and the  colors match the colors used in baby's outfits on the market - which is very nice. The \"non-slip\" part is the printing on the bottom of the feet that says \"Loveable Friends\". It is a soft rubberish kind of printing that feels very nice to the fingers. We started using these when our baby had just turned 5 months old and they stayed on just as well then. They seem like they will fit her for another few months.

While much negative commentary concerning Levi Strauss's move away from domestic manufacturing has focused on the button-fly 501s, the bigger problem I have seen is with the old 1970's standby, the 505, which has a zipper as opposed to button fly. The variability on sizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order. The 501 are easier to buy online or by mail order because the sizing is much less critical on the waist, which is the so-called \"anti-fit\" waist, meaning there is no curve to the rise (the distance between the crotch and the top of the waist), because the original 501s were merely cut down bib overalls which were made to hang, rather than be fitted to the waist. The biggest problem I have noted on the 505's is the variability in size in the thigh area, meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight, even though they are theoretically the same size of a label. The 501s are pretty safe as far as sizing.",

It was certainly WELL worth the price I paid. \n\nIf you like wearing extreme low-rise jeans or simply do not want to flash your waistband for any reason, then this brief is for you. Period. \n\nFor those men who wear standard low-rise jeans or the like, then you do not NEED this, but you still very well may WANT it. \n\nClearly this brief is meant to do two things (1) make it so that you can wear very low-rise pants and (2) make it so you look irresistable when you are NOT wearing your low-rise pants. \n\nI found that even though the underwear is cotton - as opposed to the synthetics of the X-Factor line, for example, this brief still conforms to my body's contours pretty well. Actually very well everywhere except it bunches a LITTLE where it meets the very inside of my thigh. Regardless, this is going to show off everything you got, and subsequently make it look (more-or-less) more impressive. \n\nPractical consideration: the pouch and the area above is reduced in size since it is accomodating the very low-rise. Translation: be cautious when you get aroused as there is not a great deal of \"expansion room\". Enough said on that, but that is why I gave this pair 4\/5 stars. Everything else is great. I never had a problem with my rear being exposed in these briefs. \n\nIf you forsee this as being a problem for you, then may I suggest the 2(x)ist Contrast Countour Pouch Brief 3103C? It is the same price (at review time) and the same materials but in a standard cut and features sexy contrast lines. I own it as well and you may read my review about it on its product page",

This bra has hiked my bosom up and kept it up all day.  I have not experienced any sagging or shifting of the garment.\n\nAs I mentioned the support is excellent, it has even passed the \"jiggle test\".  If I have to hurry somewhere or, heaven forbid, break into a jog \"the girls\" stay where they ought offering no threat of injury to me or any innocent passer-by.  The side supports are, no doubt part of the reason for the bra's effectiveness but they can pinch a bit.  In short, it feels GOOD to take the bra off at the end of the day.  I do not however fantasize about slipping out of it at lunchtime to ease aching shoulders or alleviate pain as I have with some others.\n\nA bra is, quite naturally, a very personal garment and therefore difficult to recommend but I do recommend this bra for large-busted women.

In any case, when you freak out becuase you think you might not be able to get something again you realize just how much you like that thing. \n\nThese are totally windproof.  Extremely compact, I don't think you can make them any thinner than this.  Good price.  \n\nThe only \"downside\" is that they take a long time to dry out when they get wet.  This is true of any windproof glove so it's really not fair to call it a down side of this particular glove.  These weigh nothing (probably about an ounce each) and so I pack two or three pairs if I know I'll be getting them wet. \n\nI wear these ice climbing, hiking, mountaineering, I have a pair I cut the finger tips off of for rock climbing in winter, and I wear them skiing inside of my mittens. \n\nThese really shine inside of mittens because if you have to do anything with your hands the mitten must come off and these completely protect your hands from the wind during that time.  I haven't had cold hands skiing for two seasons now, a problem that plagued me for years. \n\nI can't recommend these enough.  \n\n-Scott",

The heel does not last as long as a walking or running shoe from esprit --- that is the only draw back.\n\nSince the inside of the shoe molds to your feet, it will reflect your shoe size if you lose or gain too much weight.  When I lost weight after having my baby, I lost weight in my feet as well and I had to start wearing bulky soxs with my berks instead of stocking.\n\nWhen I first tried on my berks, they were a little tight and slightly uncomfortable but after walking around in them for about two days it loosen up and molded to my feet, -----  once that happened they were very comfortable from then on.\n\nAnother thing I love about it my sister cannot borrow my berks because she says they don't fit her right and they are uncomfortable. We wear the same size shoe give or take a few minor width inches here and there, but because the berks are molded to my feet imprint and my walking pattern she can't wear them comfortable.

Surprisingly, it was the best thing I purchased when I was pregnant. I actually was able to get away with not buying any maternity clothes and just wearing my old clothing but with the pants or jeans unzipped and unbuttoned. In the last month, however, I had to wear more stretchy clothes- even my jeans would not fit with the bella band. But it is great because you can have it peek out from under the shirt you are wearing for a layered look. It is just a great product. Can't say enough good things about it.

I bought it because it conforms to most airline's carry on requirements (It's 41 cubic inches). \nI was worried when the box arrived because it was only 4 inches thick--I thought they sent me the wrong pack because it was so thin; I would find out, however, that this is part of the genius of the design. The bottom of the suitcase is flexible, with the wheels-side acting as a pivot-point. Thus, if you do not need to fully pack the case, it will remain ultra thin. If you pack more, the bottom folds out to accommodate the material. So, if you are only going on a weekend trip, you will have no problem putting this under the seat in front of you. If you pack more, it will easily fit in the overhead bin on the aircraft. The zippers are thick, there are lots of pockets for toiletries (so it's easy to pull them out at security in their little plastic baggie) and documents, and it seems to be coated with plastic to make it waterproof. The wheels are also well-placed and are made of rubber (which makes them quiet and sturdy), but the handle extension bars could be a bit thicker; however, I'm tall, so I appreciate that the handle extends to a comfortable length, which allows me to walk without having the thing bump up against my feet all the time.\nSo, it's a well-designed, nifty little carry on that I'm quite happy with",

They almost never \"bunch up\" inside my shoes as I walk around and they are very much worth the price. They last longer so the long life of these socks justifies the slightly higher price.\n\nI also like the design of the toe section actually being gold colored fabric. Amazon points out that these socks come in your choice of four different colors: black, navy blue, grey marl and brown. The safest, most conservative choice for the corporate office is the black color; but the other colors come in handy too depending on your work\/play \"dress code.\"\n\nThese socks can easily be washed in any washer or dryer--but I would heed the manufacturer's warning about not drying them at a high temperature. High temperatures in the clothes dryer cause the sock to wear out faster. The stretch nylon will stretch even more; and then these socks will become just too loose on your feet.\n\nPlease note that these are crew length socks. They will not come up your leg to the degree that some other socks will. You may consider them to be \"too short.\" On the other hand, the socks also fit shoe sizes 7 through 12 so it's almost one size fits all. \n\nOverall, Gold Toe is the brand to buy if you want good quality, long lasting socks. The \"Canterbury Dress Socks\" for men match any attire and they can even be worn in bed on those really cold nights to keep your feet warm! \n\nHighly recommended! May you wear them in good health!     SMILE",

        "reviews":"I purchased the Boston Clog in the summer of 2000, have worn it every year since then, and am happy to report that it is still the most comfortable shoe I possess.  Since many of the other reviews here have praised its comfort, I will briefly pass over a few of the problems that will probably occur over long-term wear.\n\nFirst, after about a year of wear, the outsole began to detach itself from the rest of the clog.  This was easily fixed with some shoe glue that I purchased at a shoe store.  Since applying it in 2001 or so, I have not had any further problems with the outsole coming off.\n\nSecond, as mentioned in one review, the part of the outsole where your foot hits the ground most often will wear out fastest. This is to be expected.  Nevertheless, after close to seven year's worth of wear, the outsole is still holding up quite well, the heel being the only place where there is no grip pattern left.  Still, plenty of outsole remains.\n\nFinally, about a year ago the leather lining of the footbed started to detach itself from the cork underneath the heel.  Again, any good adhesive will solve the problem.  This time I used super glue--problem solved.  \n\nOverall, the leather reflects seven year's worth of use, but it is still holding up very well, both on the footbed, and on the entire upper part.  All things considered, I have worn a lot of shoes in the past seven years, many of them overpriced European brands fabled for comfort (Ecco, Camper, Clarks) but the Boston Clog has outlasted all of them in terms of durability and comfort.  I highly recommend this quality shoe",

Ideally, I want one that would carry the essentials (ID, plastic, cash, cell, sunglasses, pen and notepad) as well as a book and a water bottle, but I was just shooting for most of my desires. This little bag holds my essentials just dandy, but it's just shy of carrying a paperback for me. So, for the most part I hardly use that second large zippered pocket. \n\nThe Velcroed cell phone pocket is roomy for my flip-phone, but not too roomy. Next to the pen holder is a small zippered pocket, which runs deep behind the pen and cell phone pockets -ample space for a notepad. The front main zippered compartment holds a small zippered pocket inside that is great for cash and cards. The shoulder strap is removable, and there are straps on the back for looping through a belt or whatnot. I never found it necessary, but you may find it useful.\n\nWhile it wasn't quite what I was hoping for, it is a good bag all-in-all.\n\nOh, and fair warning -the bag absolutely stank when it arrived. Blame it on the chemicals that fabrics are treated with, but you will want to toss it in the wash when you get it. And it survives it just fine.",

Not too knobby to use on the treadmill so I'd have to say they are a great all around running shoe and are A+ for outdoors\/x-country or winter running.  The goretex weather proofing didn't make my feet too hot.  Probably an overkill if you don't plan to use them for running, the knobby tread can make you trip if you're just walking, etc.  I haven't used them in bad weather but I would imagine they would be great for running in rain\/snow\/ice conditions.

Just recently I've noticed that the front part of the soles has worn down and they are smooth now. Also the foam bed has started to crack in several places, but for the price I'd say I've gotten reasonable use out of them.\n\nThe bottle opener is a great conversation piece. Also rest assured, they do hold up to wear and tear. I was skeptical when I bought these how long they'd stay intact, but I can attest that they are still in and functional... kinda mangled, but still intact and functioning.\n\nAlso, if you think you're just gonna swing your leg up and crack open a beer like Mr. Joe Cool, then think again. I remember when I first got these I was at a backyard house party while in San Diego. I was flirting with these two girls, talkin' my game and trying to be super cool. So I grab another beer, and while talking to them, I lift my foot and try to crack the bottle open. Well, between trying to keep my balance and get the lip of the cap in the opener, I apparently shook it up a bit. When I finally did open it, the resulting explosion of foam shot all over me and the two girls. Not cool.\n\nI would suggest taking the sandal off to use the bottle opener feature.\n\nAll and all, a great shoe. Fun and easy to wear.\n\nAnother tip: Make sure you wash these every so often! Stick 'em in the washing machine. I neglected to do this and developed a nasty case of athlete's foot from them. Just a heads up. Enjoy",

They are warm and I would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily.  But I did only pay 2.99 for them so I guess it's a case of you get what you pay for.",

The leather on this case is soft to the touch.  The flip-design is nice, and the magnets work much better than a snap or velcro would - I was also wary of the magnets screwing up my harddrive, but I haven't had a problem with it.\n\nOne more thing: the belt clip is a piece of leather on the back with velcro and a snap, so there is a chance that it could get ripped off of your belt if you are doing some wild activity while wearing your ipod on your belt.

They are indeed very cute on -- but run a half size large so buy a half-size down. I ended up returning them because I wore them around the house, and noticed my ankles were being forced to bend inwards. The size was correct, but the shoe is built to angle inward. I didn't wear them long enough to have pain, but it definitely was getting uncomfortable. The other annoying thing was the straps wouldn't stay shut, the velcro kept releasing. I was constantly re-fastening them just the short time I wore them. The style is perfect, I hope Skechers tweaks this model to fix what is wrong. I ended up buying the Skechers Bikers Tailgater (runs true to size), which is similar but has a better velcro strap, and have suede inserts where the mesh ones are on the Sightseers (I would have preferred the mesh given I was buying them for Florida)",

        "reviews":"The best Swim suit that I have ever seen in the US\n\nI strongly believe that this is the best Speedo suits that I have ever bought in this country. The swim suites being made of very soft and elastic fabric, it does not cause the itchiness on your waste, hips, and crotch, which usually happens when you put on small Speedos like this. The suits actually have only one inch cloth on the sides, you may move your legs in the water very easily, and it makes your swim performance far better than the other Speedos. Another good feature of this suit is that there are many variation of color. I own white, black and dark blue one. I personally do not recommend the one in white and very light color, since it become absolutely see-through when wet.\n\nI know there is one big concern when men wearing this suite. Here is my comment to someone who does not have confidence to wear them in swimming pool: To be frank, my friends told me that the suits are little revealing since those have high-leg cut and made of thin fabric. In fact, even in the darker colors, shape of your\"manhood\" will be somewhat revealed especially when wet in these suits. (But not see-through) However, don't you think it always happens when you are in any Speedos as long you have the \"organ?\" it is absolutely more strange if that part was completely flat. In addition, any swimming suits have more or less this feature. If you are a person who thinks that is unfavorable, you may want to stop swimming in pool and do the other work outs. In other words, people might see you package occasionally since it has high leg cut and adhere to your body. However who cares, stares, and makes fun of it all the time when you are in swimming pool? The suites cover only essential part because it was made to swim fast, but absolutely not to reveal your manhood and pull attention from others. Don't you agree?\n\n I recommend you to try it at least once if you are swimmers who seriously want to swim fast. The price being around $20, it is affordable as the second swim ware. I realized that the actual size of the waist of this suite might be a little bigger than the jeans or pants. Therefore, you will feel more comfortable if you buy a one size smaller. Like myself, I usually ware jeans or pants in the size of 29. Therefore I chose 28 and perfectly fit me. The fabric being elastic, it stretches a bit. However, if you worry about the size, just buy the exact size. I love this suit and ware it all at least once a week. As other people wrote previously, the color fades relatively fast in pool water. Therefore, I would suggest you buy two pairs and wear it in turns.",

They can be worn during hiking trips without the fear of the soles being punctured by brush. \n\nIt's rare to see, but the Betula spinoff of Birkenstock comes and goes every couple years or so. The pair Im replacing are Betulas and I bought them 3yrs ago. As it turns out, you can have Birkenstock sandals repaired over time as long as the cork isnt too badly damaged. All one has to do is take them to a liscensed dealer and 25.00 later, you have a repaired pair of sandals. \n\nOther brands can come up with knockoffs, but nothing matches a true anatomically correct Birkenstock. \n\nI suggest going to a store that sells Birkenstocks and seeing what size your largest foot is before buying online so as to avoid the hassle of having to mail back the sandals and trying to get the correct size. Once you have all the necessary info, you are set to buy them to your feet's content. You wont regret buying these sandals. The comfort is unmatched. It doesnt matter if you are using them around the house or taking them on a tour of a big city. They wont let your feet become weary",

The two twisting strands were very helpful--no clips required.

Hands down this was the best purchase - even better than the $65 I spent on the Le Mystere bra.

I can even wear it with many of my plunging tops and feel sexy without being over the top. One thing to note is that it puts the breasts pretty close together - and since I am 5' 1\" and a size 2 that works well for me as I am pretty small framed.

        "reviews":"I did a great deal of research in choosing a case for my new iPod. I decided on the iSkin, and I have been quite satisfied with my decision. I do remember, however, being a bit confused as to just how this case worked. So, to clarify for future buyers, the case is comprised of:\n\n-First, a thin, transparent silicone (rubber) sleeve. The sleeve covers most of the front and back, including a slightly thinner cover where the wheeel would be placed. This ensures that the wheel maintains its touch sensitivity while also being protected. The skin does not, however, cover the screen, and a portion of the back is also exposed to attach an optional belt clip. This sleeve can also come in various colors, but I used the clear one to highlight the natural color of my iPod. \n\n-Second, a hard, clear plastic front plate can be snapped on to the front of the iPod once it is placed in the silicone. This hard case does cover the screen, and all of the front of the iPod, except for a hole for the touch wheel. Once attached, the hard cover is firmly held in place. \n\nPut together, this case provides exceptional protection. The silicone is very thin, yet protects against ordinary dings and scratches. The hard plastic protects the front from impact, and the screen from scratches. The best part for me is that, even with both the silicone and the hard cover, the iPod Nano still retains its very thin size - the case is not bulky in the least. \n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this case for anyone who purchases an iPod Nano.

I had purchased this item after trying out one of the silcone skins that ripped apart after about 3 months of use.  I use my MP3 player when I go running and so I need an armband product that can withstand the elements and my running.  \n\nAfter using this product only 3 times, it began to fall apart as follows:\n\n1.  The protective screen cover is nothing but a flimsly piece of plastic that is glued to the case.  It basically falls apart when you try and squeeze your vision M into the case. \n2.  There are these oddly placed velcro dots on the armband that are used to secure it after you wrap it around your arm.  The huge design flaw is that the dots needs to line up on top of one another in order to be secure.  So, if you arm is an odd sign you end up having to make it tighter in order to align the dots.  If you're in the market for a tourniquet, then you should buy this product. \n3.  If you sweat at least a drop while you exercise or run (if you don't then you're not really exercising), the velcro dots lose their stick-um.  I discovered that the fuzzy part of the velcro was glued onto the armband.  As it heats up from your body temperature rising, it literally melts and causes the dots to fall off.  It was because of this that my MP3 player almost flew off my arm and onto the cement.  \n\nSo, if you are looking to shatter your MP3 player, then buy this nifty product.  I think that my son (age 4) could've designed a better arm band holder in his pre-school class.",

        "reviews":"As I just bought two more Action Shape bras, I was compelled to write about how much I love them...\n\nA little over 10 years ago, my sister turned me on to them.  Genetically, we're predisposed to big bustlines, which has its advantages and disadvantages - one of the latter trying to find bras that fit and support and still look good.  I've tried many, many other sports bras (trying to find one from the $20 range that works) and none of the other compare - the racerback types don't give me enough support - other 'high compression' bras create that oh-so-unattractive 'uniboob' look; underwire sports bras have a very short life - they're a pain to keep washed and it doesn't take long for the underwire to pop out of the underarm area (ouch - always seemed to happen during a heavy workout!), et cetera.\n\nThe Champion Action Shape takes care of ALL of that.  There is enough separation where this looks fine even wearing under a shirt (I've even been able to wear this bra under a blouse or sweater if I'm planning on going horseback riding after work).  The straps and fasteners are totally adjustable.  The bra is mostly cotton, there might be some lycra or polyester there but I'm a cotton freak - no itchiness, no seams that chafe, and best of all NO UNDERWIRE!  It's totally supportive - as I mentioned, I ride horseback (this trumps the popular rider's \"No Bounce Bra\" that sells for over $50 and has a ton of hooks - like a corset - UGH), and am also a gym rat, doing high-impact aerobics, weight training, Spinning, Pilates and yoga - this bra is EMINENTLY suitable for all those activities.  Care is easy - just toss it in the washer and dryer or air dry (I generally airdry as the hooks have a tendency to get caught in the 'holes' in the dryer).  And they look GOOD.  I just wear this as a top on its own.\n\nBTW Champion has come out with a new color this year - Champion RED.  I just got it and it looks AWESOME!\n\nHIGHLY recommended",

They are 100% combed cotton, feel soft and nice, and even the elastic waist band is cotton covered for extra added comfort.\nThe 3-pack of black assorted I received contains 1 solid black pair and 2 pair that are a light green with a very pretty darker design of little flowers and box shapes.They still fit great even after laundering(the instructions say dry on medium but I used low).The price seemed just a little high but they are an excellent quality and have lasted through countless washings.\n\nThis style may also be found at \"Bare Necessities\"  The prices at this time are exactly the same at the 3 sites. What I usually do is check for what the deals are on the shipping charges(this will depend on how much you are spending with each merchant in total) and also, you may find a different variety of colors or patterns at each. Just type in Jockey Elance 3 pack Bikini. This one is style 1449(check editorial description on product page to make sure), and just judging from the reviews of the other styles, these are the best in quality and comfort.\n\nOOOOkay...so even though the world now knows what kind of underwear I wear, it's a product I thought worth a review.\n\nYou NEED these!....Happy Shopping......Laurie",

But I didn't want to go all out and get those tiny suits that Olympic swimmers and Europeans wear so this was a nice compromise.\n\nRemember that it's a snug, tight suit so if you normally wear a Medium pair of surfing trunks, you'll want a Large size here cause it will feel uncomfortably tight and make you feel VERY self-conscious when you step out of the changing room.\n\nMaterial is very good.  It stretches well, dries quickly.  The elastic in the waistband, however, is not attached so everytime you take off the suit, the waistband elastic gets all twisted around.  It's not difficulat to manually twist 'em back into shape --but it's still annoying.\n\nBecause it's so snug, there are no pockets of any kind and no place to put your locker key.\n\nOverall, it's a good product.  But you better not be self-conscious about your body --this is the man's equivalent of a thong bikini (considering how modest men's --at least American men's-- swimwear has become).  I felt very self-conscious at first but since I only wore them to the gym to swim laps, I didn't care so much about how I looked and I really appreciated the fact that this was comfortable to swim in.  But now, after a year of dedicated working out, I'm starting to look GOOD and these swimtrunks really accentuate the broad shoulders and tight abs.  I even wear them around the house cause it drives my wife nuts (in a good way).  And now that James Bond wore something like these in Casino Royale, it won't be too weird for me to wear this to the beach this summer",

Unfortunately I was told by PacificPlex that they were sold out of smalls in the white color (although they are selling them now).  I had to get my dress altered in the bust and waist (the length was perfect).  The material is not \"satin\" as stated but a satin-like polyester which is a bit see-through so definitely need a slip or something.  For the price it is still great.  \nI've been looking for my dress for months and couldn't find any that were slim fitting with a halter top so when I saw this dress (at only $119) I was pretty excited.  I've never bought clothes online and I'm not sure I will in the future but I am glad I bought this dress. \nI just wish PacificPlex would have told me they had more dresses on order(as I was still well within the 30 day refund guarantee).  It would have been cheaper to exchange than to get the alterations. Although my seamstress did say that based on how big the medium was on me, the small probably would have needed to be taken in as well.  Oh well, it fits and I'm happy now",

        "reviews":"I had plantar fasciitis two years ago and the suede Arizona Birks were the only shoes I could wear comfortably for months. It took a couple of days to break the shoes in due to the firm footbed and heel cup, but once they were broken in, it was bliss. A good friend of mine recently had plantar fasciitis herself and also began wearing the Arizona Birks. Ever since my own PF episode, I've avoided going barefoot around the house and wear only the Arizona Birks while indoors. They've held up remarkably well, and I dread the day something accidentally happens to them which means I have to buy another pair of Arizonas just in case.\n\nI know they're more expensive than most sandals -- mine cost $110 at a mall store -- but they're worth the money. I have flat feet, while my friend has a really high arch, yet the Arizona Birks work wonderfully for both of us. I now have about 12 pairs of Birkenstocks in a variety of styles, and plan on buying more. Birkenstocks give tremendous support with its toe grip and molded footbed, especially since it conforms to your foot within a few days. If you want the best variety of Birks, you should check out the QVC website. They have dozens of styles, and some of the best prices on Birkenstocks around",

        "reviews":"Gold Toe makes the best socks I've ever worn, and I've been buying them for as long as I can remember.  Normally I would get the cotton crew socks but decided to give these a try.  These are a medium heavy cotton sock that fits well and will probably last forever.  They may seem a bit loose at first, but one washing will pull them back into shape and keep them up.  Furthermore, they are a little thicker than normal socks, but not as thick as a wool rag.  So, consider how your shoes fit before getting these.  If they are snug, these sock will just make them snugger.  Finally, I like the color selection on these socks.\n\nOh, yeah.  Believe it or not, Gold Toe has a fantastic customer service department.  I sent them some digital photos of some socks I can't find anymore and they matched them up.  That, and Amazon's prices are worth 5 stars right there",

My daughter wore a size 2T clothes and these tights were sized 1-3 and they fit her very nicely.  They aren't as thick as I thought they would be but they are opaque (definitely not thin or cheap) and are made from a strong material--my daughter loves to run, and as a result, fall, and she hasn't ripped them yet.

First off, they don't fit like the old CK crew necks... they are, in fact, shorter and the waist is wider. The length isn't bad- it's the waist width that is too large and makes the shirt ill-fitting. (I have an average body-type) After just a few washings, some of the stitching started coming undone, and there were loose strands on the inner parts of the shirts. I'm continually trimming these loose ends. Although that didn't affect the way these shirts fit, I would expect better stitching from CK. I do wear the shirts under sweaters or jackets, but I feel awkward wearing them on their own as outerwear due to the fit. I don't recommend these shirts. I'd rather pay more for American Apparel or Banana Republic",
